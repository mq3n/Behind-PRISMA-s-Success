Applicability Evaluation and Reflection on Artificial Intelligence-based “Image to Image” Generation of Landscape Architecture Masterplans; [人工智能“图生图”式景观平面生成技术的适用性评价与反思],"Artificial intelligence (AI) image generation is revolutionizing traditional workflow in landscape architecture industry, among which the “image-to-image” generative adversarial network (GAN) exhibits potential to facilitate concept design. Therefore, it underscores the importance of applicability evaluation from the perspective of users. This research aims to evaluate the quality of the GAN-generated results, their effectiveness in integrating with design workflows, and the landscape architects’ acceptance of the results through image analysis and user survey. The evaluation focuses on layout generation and masterplan rendering within the Pix2Pix-BicycleGAN workflow. The evaluation metrics of image analysis including block number absolute/Euclidean distance, histogram distance, and structural similarity index measure, were employed. Additionally, the online survey with two questionnaires was conducted to evaluate the visual realism and preference for color and texture of the GAN-generated results. The findings indicate that the GAN-generated layout exhibits a high similarity to the human-designed layout, and the GAN-rendered masterplans fulfill the criteria for concept design and garner positive user acceptance. Conclusively, this study delves into the intrinsic rationality of the GAN generation methods and limitations in professional ethics and data bias, reflecting on the gaps between current AI-assisted design methods and evidence-based design. © Higher Education Press 2024.",2-s2.0-85213231289
Towards Reproducible Research in Machine Learning via Blockchain,"Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Machine Learning and related research areas such as Operational Research, currently faces a reproducibility crisis. Researchers encounter difficulties reproducing key results due to lacking critical details, including the disconnection between publications and the associated codes, data, and parameter settings. Solutions that improve code accessibility, data provenance tracking, research transparency, auditing of obtained results, and trust can significantly accelerate algorithm and model development, validation, and transition into real-world applications. Blockchain technology, with its features of decentralization, data immutability, cryptographic hash functions, and consensus algorithms, provides a promising avenue for developing such solutions. By leveraging the distributed ledger working over a peer-to-peer network, a secure and auditable infrastructure can be established for sharing and controlling data in a trusted manner. Our analysis examines the current state-of-the-art blockchain-based proposals that target reproducibility issues in the Machine Learning domain. Based on the analysis of existing solutions, we propose a high-level architecture and main modules for developing a blockchain-based platform that enhances reproducible research in Machine Learning and can be adapted to other Artificial Intelligence domains. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",2-s2.0-85215955448
Classification of architectural styles in Chinese traditional settlements using remote sensing images and building facade pictures,"The classification of Chinese traditional settlements (CTSs) is extremely important for their differentiated development and protection. The innovative double-branch classification model developed in this study comprehensively utilized the features of remote sensing (RS) images and building facade pictures (BFPs). This approach was able to overcome the limitations of previous methods that used only building facade images to classify settlements. First, the features of the roofs and walls were extracted using a double-branch structure, which consisted of an RS image branch and BFP branch. Then, a feature fusion module was designed to fuse the features of the roofs and walls. The precision, recall, and F1-score of the proposed model were improved by more than 4% compared with the classification model using only RS images or BFPs. The same three indexes of the proposed model were improved by more than 2% compared with other deep learning models. The results demonstrated that the proposed model performed well in the classification of architectural styles in CTSs. © Science Press 2024.",2-s2.0-85211352369
ConvFormer: Combining CNN and Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation,"Convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods have achieved great successes in medical image segmentation, but their capability to learn global representations is still limited due to using small effective receptive fields of convolution operations. Transformer based methods are capable of modelling long-range dependencies of information for capturing global representations, yet their ability to model local context is lacking. Integrating CNN and Transformer to learn both local and global representations while exploring multi-scale features is instrumental in further improving medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical CNN and Transformer hybrid architecture, called ConvFormer, for medical image segmentation. ConvFormer is based on several simple yet effective designs. (1) A feed forward module of Deformable Transformer (DeTrans) is re-designed to introduce local information, called Enhanced DeTrans. (2) A residual-shaped hybrid stem based on a combination of convolutions and Enhanced DeTrans is developed to capture both local and global representations to enhance representation ability. (3) Our encoder utilizes the residual-shaped hybrid stem in a hierarchical manner to generate feature maps in different scales, and an additional Enhanced DeTrans encoder with residual connections is built to exploit multi-scale features with feature maps of different scales as input. Experiments on several datasets show that our ConvFormer, trained from scratch, outperforms various CNN- or Transformer-based architectures, achieving state-of-the-art performance. © 2023 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85172123148
"Big geodata aggregation: Connotation, classification, and framework; [地理大数据聚合的内涵、分类与框架]","Big geodata can be regarded as the ""footprints"" generated by geographic objects, which are divided into two types: big earth observation data and big social behavior data. Big earth observation data refer to remote sensing data and all kinds of monitoring data from ground observation stations; big social behavior data are defined as the data generated by humans, such as mobile phone data, traffic card data, social media data, and trajectory data of floating cars. Big earth observation data contain the information of land surface, and big social behavior data record the social behavior of humans. The essence of big geodata mining is to reveal the man-land relationship via the retrieval of the ""footprint"" of geographic objects. Magnificent progresses in recent years demonstrate that most of them have been made through the aggregation of multiple types of big geodata. The significance of big geodata aggregation can be summarized into three aspects: to represent a new research paradigm, to produce a new research angle, and to improve the research quality by combining different types of information. In contrast to image fusion, which is regarded as the combination of imageries with the same data structure, big geodata aggregation is defined as the merging of different types of big geodata into a multidimensional dataset through transformation in terms of structure, content, and representation. In general, big geodata aggregation includes big earth observation data and big social behavior data. Given the differences in data source, data structure, connotation, and granularity, the aggregation procedure is various and complicated. Considering the characteristics and the classification of big geodata, we classify big geodata aggregation into four types: spatiotemporal aggregation, object-oriented aggregation, topic-oriented aggregation, and model-oriented aggregation. In spatiotemporal aggregation, data are merged via their common locations, such as the aggregation between POI and remote sensing data. In object-oriented aggregation, data are connected through the same object, such as the aggregation of indoor and outdoor trajectory data via the same phone carrier. In topic-oriented aggregation, data with the same topic are integrated, such as the aggregation of different types of information sourced from the same earthquake event. In model-oriented aggregation, data are assimilated via the same model, such as the aggregation of street view data and POI data when using a deep learning model for the recognition of building style. As an important part of big geodata mining, the procedure of big geodata aggregation can be divided into four steps: the determination of the aggregation core, information back tracking, retrieving, and converging. The key issues in big geodata aggregation include unifying spatiotemporal benchmarks, uniting data representation and storage, matching multisource big geodata from the same geo-object, centralizing the spatiotemporal scope of multisource big geodata, settling the changing velocities of different objects, solving data-sharing and privacy protection problems, and aggregating big and small geodata. With the development of methods and techniques of big geodata aggregation, some research areas, including the sensing of places, the identification of land functions, the detection of crowd activities, the determination of the relationship between urban functions and multisource flow, and the introduction of a land surface complex giant system, may be substantially expanded. © 2021, Science Press.

Applications of a Deep Neural Network to Illustration Art Style Design of City Architectural,"With the continuous advancement of computer technology, deep learning models have emerged as innovative tools in shaping various aspects of architectural design. Recognizing the distinctive perspective of children, which differs significantly from that of adults, this paper contends that conventional standards may not always be the most suitable approach in designing urban structures tailored for children. The primary objective of this study is to leverage neural style networks within the design process, specifically adopting the artistic viewpoint found in children's illustrations. By combining the aesthetic paradigm of urban architecture with inspiration drawn from children's aesthetic preferences, the aim is to unearth more creative and subversive aesthetics that challenge traditional norms. The selected context for exploration is the landmark buildings in Qingdao City, Shandong Province, China. Employing the neural style network, the study uses architectural elements of the chosen buildings as content images while preserving their inherent characteristics. The process involves artistic stylization inspired by classic children's illustrations and images from children's picture books. Acting as a conduit for deep learning technology, the research delves into the prospect of seamlessly integrating architectural design styles with the imaginative world of children's illustrations. The outcomes aim to provide fresh perspectives and effective support for the artistic design of contemporary urban buildings. © 2024 KIPS. All Rights Reserved.",2-s2.0-85188600453
Comparison of ResNet50V2 and MobileNetV2 Models in Building Architectural Style Classification,"Artificial intelligence and image processing methods are key in classifying architectural styles in this digital era. Previous research has demonstrated the success of Deep Learning (DL) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques in classifying architectural styles, but variations in accuracy and challenges in dealing with variations in lighting, shooting angles, and complexity of architectural styles remain a concern. Through literature exploration, it was found that a direct comparison between the ResNet50V2 and MobileNetV2 models in the context of architectural style classification has never been carried out thoroughly. Disadvantages of existing methods include a better understanding of the model's ability to distinguish subtle nuances in architectural design. This research aims to compare the performance of ResNet50V2 and MobileNetV2 in architectural style classification. ResNet50V2 achieved 93% accuracy, while MobileNetV2 achieved 82%. Graphical analysis and evaluation metrics, including confusion matrices and classification reports, provide deep insight into their performance. In conclusion, ResNet50V2 and MobileNetV2 have their respective advantages and disadvantages. ResNet50V2 shows high and stable accuracy, while MobileNetV2 shows stability with certain fluctuations. Both models have the potential to be used in architectural style classification, but model selection must consider the specific needs and characteristics of the dataset. This research is expected to provide valuable guidance for developing more efficient and reliable classification methods in understanding and preserving building architectural styles. This research contribution is relevant to the industrial development trend, which increasingly relies on technology to increase efficiency and accuracy in various tasks. © 2024 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85202355094
"Comparative Study of Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, and Transformer in Transformer (TNT) on Image Classification","The advent of transformer models in computer vision has revolutionized image classification, significantly improving performance compared to standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Among these models, the Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, and Transformer in Transformer (TNT) represent three leading architectures that apply self-attention mechanisms to image data. In this paper, we perform a comparative evaluation of these models using the CIFAR-10 dataset, focusing on classification performance, computational complexity, and training efficiency. We assess each model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and confusion matrices. ViT provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for leveraging global context in image understanding. Swin Transformer introduces a hierarchical design and shifted windows to improve computational efficiency. TNT enhances the process further by enabling fine-grained local and global attention through inner- patch and patch tokenization. Our findings indicate that while TNT achieves the highest overall accuracy and robustness, Swin Transformer maintains an excellent balance between accuracy and computational efficiency on smaller datasets like CIFAR-10. © 2025 IEEE.",2-s2.0-105018475240
The microscopic visual forms in architectural art design following deep learning,"The purpose is to analyze the architectural art design of microscopic visual forms based on deep learning. First, GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) of deep learning is applied to the field of architecture, and a multi-adversarial information sharing GAN is proposed through the improvement of GAN, and an architecture generation model of microscopic visual forms based on deep learning is constructed. The model is stimulated and its accuracy, distortion, and stability are analyzed. The results show that the accuracy of the model can reach more than 80% on different datasets. Compared with the other models in the related field, the model built in this study can show the features of the building images with the minimum distortion. Meanwhile, the curve hovers are around 0 in the process of model training, which is balanced. Therefore, the research can significantly improve the accuracy and the effect of feature extraction, and provide an experimental basis for the later architectural design of microscopic visual forms. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2-s2.0-85106670332
Augmenting Design: Solving design problems using generative deep learning frameworks with multiple objectives,"In recent years, generative machine learning methods such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) have opened up new avenues of exploration for architects and designers. The presented work explores how these methods can be expanded by incorporating multiple abstract criteria directly into the formulation of the algorithm that negotiates these complex criteria and proposes a fitting design. It draws inspiration from the works of several design theorists who have developed such goal-oriented approaches to design, and sets up multiple-objective VAE and GAN frameworks with this idea in mind. The research demonstrates that by incorporating multiple constraints using auxiliary discriminator networks, the developed algorithms are able to generate innovative solutions to two example problems: the design of 2D digits, and the design of 3D voxel chairs. By speculating and examining the role of the designer in data based generative computational design workflows, the research aims to provide an approach for solving design tasks in the age of big data. © Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture Annual Conference, ACADIA 2021.",2-s2.0-85135368699
Point cloud semantic segmentation using a deep learning framework for cultural heritage,"In the Digital Cultural Heritage (DCH) domain, the semantic segmentation of 3D Point Clouds with Deep Learning (DL) techniques can help to recognize historical architectural elements, at an adequate level of detail, and thus speed up the process of modeling of historical buildings for developing BIM models from survey data, referred to as HBIM (Historical Building Information Modeling). In this paper, we propose a DL framework for Point Cloud segmentation, which employs an improved DGCNN (Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network) by adding meaningful features such as normal and colour. The approach has been applied to a newly collected DCH Dataset which is publicy available: ArCH (Architectural Cultural Heritage) Dataset. This dataset comprises 11 labeled points clouds, derived from the union of several single scans or from the integration of the latter with photogrammetric surveys. The involved scenes are both indoor and outdoor, with churches, chapels, cloisters, porticoes and loggias covered by a variety of vaults and beared by many different types of columns. They belong to different historical periods and different styles, in order to make the dataset the least possible uniform and homogeneous (in the repetition of the architectural elements) and the results as general as possible. The experiments yield high accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness and suitability of the proposed approach. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2-s2.0-85082303972
A self-sparse generative adversarial network for autonomous early-stage design of architectural sketches,"This study develops an autonomous design method for architectural shape sketches by a novel self-sparse generative adversarial network (self-sparse GAN), thereby overcoming the problems regarding excessive reliance on sufficient aesthetic knowledge and excessive time consumption in traditional human design. First, a new architectural shape dataset denoted “Sketch” is built by using the eXtended difference-of-Gaussians operator. Second, a self-adaptive sparse transform module (SASTM) is designed following each deconvolution layer of the proposed self-sparse GAN to utilize the sparsity of sketch images by the sparsity decomposition and feature-map recombination. Third, the Frechet inception distance (FID) is adopted to evaluate the quality of the generated sketches by comparing the distribution of the real and generated datasets. Finally, two common image generation approaches, Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty and self-attention GAN, are compared with the proposed self-sparse GAN, and results show the proposed method achieves the best performance with a relative decrease in the FID score of 11.87%. The proposed autonomous design method can give tens of thousands of sketches for a class of buildings in a few seconds using the trained network, which can help architects to choose the architectural form and/or inspire architects to consider unique schemes in the early stages of design. © 2021 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering",2-s2.0-85113243800
Latent morphologies: Encoding architectural features and decoding their structure through artificial intelligence,"This article explores the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the architectural discipline, focusing on generative models and their controllability. While generative models have revolutionized the design process by freeing designers from specific tasks and allowing them to focus on desired results, the reliance on randomness frequently hinders controllability and meaningful experimentation. To address this challenge, the article proposes the construction of an encyclopedic architectural dataset, encompassing various architectural projects and combining images with text for multimodal applications and two methodologies, multi-class StyleGAN and multimodal StyleGAN+CLIP to enhance controllability. Utilizing specific conditions, multi-class StyleGAN enables designers to navigate latent space and identify hidden patterns, while StyleGAN+CLIP integrates text to achieve specific controllability and generate diverse architectural features.

Understanding architecture age and style through deep learning,"Architectural styles and their evolution are central to architecture history. However, traditional approaches to understand styles and their evolution require domain expertise, fieldwork and extensive manual processes. Recent research in deep learning and computer vision has highlighted the great potential in analyzing urban environments from images. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based framework for understanding architectural styles and age epochs by deciphering building façades based on street-level imagery. The framework is composed of two stages: Deep ‘Learning’ the architecture and Deep ‘Interpreting’ the architecture age epochs and styles. In Deep ‘Learning’, a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model is designed to automatically learn about the age characteristics of building façades from street view images. In Deep ‘Interpreting’ stage, three components are proposed to understand the different perspectives regarding building ages and styles. In the experiment, a building age epoch dataset is compiled for the city of Amsterdam and Stockholm to understand the evolution of architectural element styles and the relationship between building ages and styles spatially and temporally. This research illustrates how publicly available data and deep learning could be used to trace the evolution of architectural styles in the spatial-temporal domain. © 2022",2-s2.0-85131439428
Comparative Analysis of Transformer and CNN in Image Recognition Applications,"Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer are two mainstream model architectures for deep learning in image recognition and classification tasks. The purpose of this paper is to explore the performance differences between the two through comparative experiments, so as to provide more comprehensive guidance for model selection.

As a representative, the performance of the two in shallow and deep layers was compared from the perspectives of theoretical analysis and experimental results. The results show that the Transformer performs well in shallow networks and is suitable for handling tasks that require global feature capture. CNN, on the other hand, gradually exert their feature extraction capabilities in deep networks, which are suitable for processing complex image classification tasks.

Constructing a Semantic System of Facade Elements for Religious Architecture from a Regional Perspective: A Case Study of Jingzhou,"The application of semantics in facade elements mainly involves the association between architectural elements and their cultural, historical, or functional significance. By analyzing the shape, layout, and decoration of various elements (such as windows, doors, decorative patterns) in facades, semantics helps us understand the symbolic meanings and cultural implications behind these design choices. This study selects twenty-eight pavilions and buildings from five temples and Taoist sites in Jingzhou City as the research objects, exploring the composition and patterns of religious architectural facades in Jingzhou through the extraction of structural and decorative elements.

Unboxing the Black Box of Attention Mechanisms in Remote Sensing Big Data Using XAI,"This paper presents exploratory work looking into the effectiveness of attention mechanisms (AMs) in improving the task of building segmentation based on convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones. Firstly, we evaluate the effectiveness of CNN-based architectures with and without AMs. Secondly, we attempt to interpret the results produced by the CNNs using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods.

"Architectural Proposal for Reproducible, Standardized Deep Learning Research","The lack of reproducibility of research results is one of the most recurring issues in deep learning (DL) research, with many researchers associating DL research with a reproducibility crisis. We identify technical obstacles due to the architectural design of state-of-the-art (meta) DL frameworks impeding re-producibility. To achieve high reproducibility, most frameworks only provide a set of high-level functions similar to the structure of libraries, forcing researchers to implement boilerplate code from scratch for training and evaluation pipelines. We argue that a well-thought architectural design, leveraging established design paradigms such as the inversion of control paradigm, dependency injection, and strategy pattern, already allows for the maximization of reproducibility, without necessitating mentioned implementational overhead by the user. Our analysis of existing DL frameworks unveils that their lack of reproducibility is often induced by conflicting design decisions which favor code flexibility / hackability. Based on our proposed architectural design and utilization of dedicated design patterns, we propose MLgym, a prototypical PyTorch-based open-source DL framework, maintaining full control over the training and evaluation pipeline, as well as, allowing for the implementation of the reproducibility requirements demanded in various research papers. © 2025 IEEE.",2-s2.0-105007934008
Low-resource GAN-stack for high-resolution floor plan generation with enhanced evaluation and contextual validation,"The fast and reliable prototyping of floor plan layouts is a crucial element in the early stage of the building construction cycle. The purpose of this study is to ameliorate the major difficulties associated with the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for automating high-resolution floor plan generation: vast computational and data requirements, training instability, and problematic result evaluation. A stable resource-efficient multi-module GAN-stack framework is proposed comprising pre-processing (denoising and 4× down-sampling), floor plan image generation, and up-sampling modules. Each module is individually optimized. An innovative holistic evaluation framework of the generated building floor plans is presented covering image quality, diversity, truthfulness, overall training time, energy spent during training and associated carbon emissions. A novel validation framework is introduced, involving contextual building functionality, data privacy, capability to manipulate design generation to suit the designer's desires, usability in BIM downstream tasks, and inference speed. Results demonstrate that the apropos network architecture choices allow for significantly cutting down the wall clock training time (<60 h) while maintaining superior generated image quality and contextual meaningfulness, given only sub-thousand 1024 × 1024 training images of single-story residential Danish homes and a limited computing resource (a single RTX-3090 GPU).

Connoisseur: Classification of styles of Mexican architectural heritage with deep learning and visual attention prediction,"The automatic description of multimedia content was mainly developed for classification tasks, retrieval systems and massive ordering of data. Preservation of cultural heritage is a field of high importance for application to this method. Our problem is classification of architectural styles of buildings in digital photographs of Mexican cultural heritage. The selection of relevant content in the scene for training classification models allows them to be more precise in the classification task. Here we use a saliency-driven approach to predict visual attention in images and use it to train a Convolutional Neural Network to identify the architectural style of Mexican buildings. Also, we present an analysis of the behavior of the models trained under the traditional cropped image and the prominence maps. In this sense, we show that the performance of the saliency-based CNNs is better than the traditional training reaching a classification rate of 97% in validation dataset. It is considered that style identification with this technique can make a wide contribution in video description tasks, specifically in the automatic documentation of Mexican cultural heritage. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",2-s2.0-85030784474
Deep Learning Architect: Classification for Architectural Design Using Artificial Intelligence,"In this paper, we use cutting-edge deep learning and computer vision to compare architectural designs from various businesses. We trained a squeeze net model using different classification algorithms to identify 1404 architects' photos with 88.6% accuracy by integrating a dataset of web-scraped photographs with our collection of architectural works. By analyzing the weights in the trained Neural Network model, we may determine the extent to which the computer understands common aesthetic traits across architects. We use this metric to categorize buildings by various architects into groups sharing commonalities in their design. We next evaluate our results against the standard categorization used by architects and historians. It is surprising that our classification of architectural styles corroborates commonly held beliefs in the field, and that the acquired knowledge of architectural characteristics is in line with a common appreciation for these styles.  © 2023 IEEE.",2-s2.0-85190511265

WikiChurches: A Fine-Grained Dataset of Architectural Styles with Real-World Challenges,"We introduce a novel dataset for architectural style classification, consisting of 9,485 images of church buildings. Both images and style labels were sourced from Wikipedia. The dataset can serve as a benchmark for various research fields, as it combines numerous real-world challenges: fine-grained distinctions between classes based on subtle visual features, a comparatively small sample size, a highly imbalanced class distribution, a high variance of viewpoints, and a hierarchical organization of labels, where only some images are labeled at the most precise level. In addition, we provide 631 bounding box annotations of characteristic visual features for 139 churches from four major categories. These annotations can, for example, be useful for research on fine-grained classification, where additional expert knowledge about distinctive object parts is often available. © 2021 Neural information processing systems foundation.

Deep learning architect: Classification for architectural design through the eye of artificial intelligence,"This paper applies state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning and computer vision to measure visual similarities between architectural designs by different architects. Using a dataset consisting of web-scraped images and an original collection of images of architectural works, we first train a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model capable of achieving 73% accuracy in classifying works belonging to 34 different architects. By examining the weights in the trained DCNN model, we are able to quantitatively measure the visual similarities between architects that are implicitly learned by our model. Using this measure, we cluster architects that are identified to be similar and compare our findings to conventional classification made by architectural historians and theorists. Our clustering of architectural designs remarkably corroborates conventional views in architectural history, and the learned architectural features also cohere with the traditional understanding of architectural designs. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",2-s2.0-85065916589

Convolution-Transformer for Image Feature Extraction,"This study addresses the limitations of Transformer models in image feature extraction, particularly their lack of inductive bias for visual structures. Compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the Transformers are more sensitive to different hyperparameters of optimizers, which leads to a lack of stability and slow convergence. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Convolution-based Efficient Transformer Image Feature Extraction Network (CEFormer) as an enhancement of the Transformer architecture. Our model incorporates E-Attention, depthwise separable convolution, and dilated convolution to introduce crucial inductive biases, such as translation invariance, locality, and scale invariance, into the Transformer framework. Additionally, we implement a lightweight convolution module to process the input images, resulting in faster convergence and improved stability. This results in an efficient convolution combined Transformer image feature extraction network. Experimental results on the ImageNet1k Top-1 dataset demonstrate that the proposed network achieves better accuracy while maintaining high computational speed. It achieves up to 85.0% accuracy across various model sizes on image classification, outperforming various baseline models. When integrated into the Mask Region-Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) framework as a backbone network, CEFormer outperforms other models and achieves the highest mean Average Precision (mAP) scores.

AN APPROACH WITH DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS FOR ACCURATE ARCHITECTURAL STYLE CLASSIFICATION,"Unlike other studies, this study aims to examine the effect of data diversity and quantity on the performance of a model rather than solely focusing on classifying architectural styles. It also seeks to emphasize the importance of selecting the appropriate number of classes in architectural style classification and to explore how determining the optimal number of classes affects the model's success. The first dataset comprises the original images (4776 images), the second dataset (10091 images) includes additional data and the third dataset (9552 images) is obtained through data augmentation. Using these three datasets, models were developed by reducing the number of classes with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which utilize convolution layers to identify local features in the images and classify them by summarizing these features. The results of the developed models show that the method of adding data and increasing data decreased the success of architectural style classification, whereas reducing the number of styles increased it. This study may lay the groundwork for the development of deep learning models for future architectural style classification. The findings of this study can significantly impact various application areas, such as analyzing architectural styles, identifying historical periods and integrating them into architectural education. © 2024, Jomard Publishing.

Architectural style classification based on DNN model,"Deep neural networks (DNN) have been widely used for image classification. One major hurdle of deep learning approaches is that large sets of labeled data are necessary, which can be prohibitively costly to obtain, particularly in architectural style classification. Data augmentation can alleviate this labeling effort. In this paper, we use data augmentation to increase the number of architectural style datasets. To extract building elements, the inputs are preprocessed by Deformable Part Model (DPM) first, and then the preprocessed images are sent to the data augmentation to increase the number of images. Next, we design a deep neural network based on GoogLeNet. The proposed network aims to learn robust feature embeddings to improve architectural style classification performance. Finally, architectural style can be classified by the robust feature embeddings. Experimental results show that our approach achieves promising performance and is superior to previous methods. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",2-s2.0-85086144925

Understanding Robustness of Transformers for Image Classification,"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have long been the architecture of choice for computer vision tasks. Recently, Transformer-based architectures like Vision Transformer (ViT) have matched or even surpassed ResNets for image classification. However, details of the Transformer architecture ±such as the use of non-overlapping patches± lead one to wonder whether these networks are as robust. In this paper, we perform an extensive study of a variety of different measures of robustness of ViT models and compare the findings to ResNet baselines. We investigate robustness to input perturbations as well as robustness to model perturbations. We find that when pre-trained with a sufficient amount of data, ViT models are at least as robust as the ResNet counterparts on a broad range of perturbations. We also find that Transformers are robust to the removal of almost any single layer, and that while activations from later layers are highly correlated with each other, they nevertheless play an important role in classification. © 2021 IEEE",2-s2.0-85120710372

A review on artificial intelligence applications for facades,"This review applies a transformer-based topic model to reveal trends and relationships in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven facade research, with a focus on architectural, environmental, and structural aspects. AI methods reviewed include Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Computer Vision (CV). Overall, a significantly growing interest in applying AI methods can be observed across all research areas. However, noticeable differences exist between the three topics. While CV and DL techniques are applied to image data in research on the architectural design of facades, research on environmental aspects of facades often uses numerical data with relatively small datasets and classical ML models. Research on facade structure also tends to use image data but also incorporates numerical performance prediction. A major limitation remains a lack of generalizability, which could be addressed by more comprehensive datasets and novel DL techniques. These include concepts such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks, where domain knowledge is integrated into hybrid data-driven models, and multi-modal diffusion models, which offer generative modeling capabilities to support inverse and forward design tasks.

ArchShapeNet: An interpretable 3D-CNN framework for evaluating architectural shapes,"In contemporary architectural design, the increasing complexity and diversity of design demands have made generative plugin tools indispensable for rapidly generating preliminary design concepts and exploring innovative 3D building forms. However, the quality differences between human-designed and machine-generated 3D forms remain challenging to analyze and interpret objectively. This challenge hinders the clear identification of the advantages of human-designed forms over machine-generated ones and limits the further optimization and application of generative tools in architectural design. To address this issue: (1) We developed ArchForms-4000, a dataset comprising 2,000 3D forms designed by professional architects and 2,000 forms generated using Evomass, which is a generative plugin tool. (2) We introduced ArchShapeNet, a 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) designed for the classification and analysis of 3D form data. To align with architectural design requirements, we integrated a 3D saliency feature analysis module, which visually highlights the key form regions that the model prioritizes, offering data-driven insights for design optimization. (3) Comparative experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses professional architects in distinguishing between human-designed and machine-generated forms, achieving a classification accuracy of 94.29%, a precision of 96.2%, and a recall of 98.51%. Moreover, our approach effectively elucidates the differences between generative plugin-generated and architect-designed forms. By examining these differences, we gain deeper insights into architects’ decision-making processes in form design and identify potential limitations in generative plugin tools.

Form data as a resource in architectural analysis: an architectural distant reading of wooden churches from the Carpathian Mountain regions of Eastern Europe,"Recent research into architectural form analysis using deep learning (DL) methods has shown potential to identify features from large collections of building data, shedding new light into formal aspects of our built environment. As these methods begin to enter architectural, urban, and policy design contexts, it becomes important to develop critical approaches to employing them. In this paper, we document and reflect upon our efforts to create a custom dataset of 3-D models of 331 wooden churches located within the Carpathian Mountains of Eastern Europe, and to use DL methods to explore this dataset with the goal of revealing unexpected formal traits and advancing architectural scholarship on this subject. While existing scholarship groups them into four distinct stylistic categories, our analysis reveals stylistic overlaps, previously undetected micro styles, and shared architectural features. We posit the resulting analyses as an example of an ‘architectural distant reading’ that enriches our understanding of this architectural typology through an unprecedentedly detailed portrait of its formal characteristics based on a large architectural dataset. Crucially, drawing on recent developments in critical data and algorithm studies, we show how the dataset construction and subsequent analyses, and their results, were shaped by slow, manual data curation processes, methodological constraints, subjective decisions, and engagements with archives, domain experts. We thus illustrate how DL techniques might be contextualized for architectural studies in relation to other modes of knowledge and labour, and offer a detailed case study of state-of-the-art computational methods enriching established approaches to architectural form and historical analysis. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2-s2.0-85158892365
Reproducibility of the Methods in Medical Imaging with Deep Learning,"Concerns about the reproducibility of deep learning research are more prominent than ever, with no clear solution in sight. The Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL) conference has made advancements in employing empirical rigor with regards to reproducibility by advocating open access, and recently also recommending authors to make their code public-both aspects being adopted by the majority of the conference submissions. We have evaluated all accepted full paper submissions to MIDL between 2018 and 2022 using established, but adjusted guidelines addressing the reproducibility and quality of the public repositories. The evaluations show that publishing repositories and using public datasets are becoming more popular, which helps traceability, but the quality of the repositories shows room for improvement in every aspect.
