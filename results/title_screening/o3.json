    "abstract":"The classification of Chinese traditional settlements (CTSs) is extremely important for their differentiated development and protection. The innovative double-branch classification model developed in this study comprehensively utilized the features of remote sensing (RS) images and building facade pictures (BFPs). This approach was able to overcome the limitations of previous methods that used only building facade images to classify settlements. First, the features of the roofs and walls were extracted using a double-branch structure, which consisted of an RS image branch and BFP branch. Then, a feature fusion module was designed to fuse the features of the roofs and walls. The precision, recall, and F1-score of the proposed model were improved by more than 4% compared with the classification model using only RS images or BFPs. The same three indexes of the proposed model were improved by more than 2% compared with other deep learning models. The results demonstrated that the proposed model performed well in the classification of architectural styles in CTSs. © Science Press 2024.",

    "abstract":"The study of the architectural heritage of the Chinese diaspora has an important role and significance in China’s historical and cultural background in the preservation of cultural data, the restoration of images, and in the analysis of human social and ideological conditions. The images from the architectural heritage of the Chinese diaspora usually include frescos, decorative patterns, chandelier base patterns, various architectural styles and other major types of architecture. Images of the architectural heritage of the Chinese diaspora in Jiangmen City, Guangdong Province, China are the research object of this study. A total of 5073 images of diaspora Chinese buildings in 64 villages and 16 towns were collected. In view of the fact that different types of image vary greatly in features while there are only small differences among the features of the same type of image, this study uses the depth learning method to design the Convolutional Neural Network Attention Retrieval Framework (CNNAR Framework). This approach can be divided into two stages. In the first stage, the transfer learning method is used to classify the image in question by transferring the trained parameters of the Paris500K datasets image source network to the target network for training, and thus the classified image is obtained. The advantage of this method is that it narrows the retrieval range of the target image. In the second stage, the fusion attention mechanism is used to extract the features of the images that have been classified, and the distance between similar images of the same type is reduced by loss of contrast. When we retrieve images, we can use the features extracted in the second stage to measure the similarities among them and return the retrieval results. The results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed method reaches 98.3% in the heritage image datasets of the JMI Chinese diaspora architectures. The mean Average Precision (mAP) of the proposed algorithm can reach 76.6%, which is better than several mainstream model algorithms. At the same time, the image results retrieved by the algorithm in this paper are very similar to those of the query image. In addition, the CNNAR retrieval framework proposed in this paper achieves accuracies of 71.8% and 72.5% on the public data sets Paris500K and Corel5K, respectively, which can be greatly generalized and can, therefore, also be effectively applied to other topics datasets. The JMI architectural heritage image database constructed in this study, which is rich in cultural connotations of diaspora Chinese homeland life, can provide strong and reliable data support for the follow-up study of the zeitgeist of the culture reflected in architecture and the integration of Chinese and Western aesthetics. At the same time, through the rapid identification, classification, and retrieval of precious architectural images stored in the database, similar target images can be retrieved reasonably and accurately; then, accurate techniques can be provided to restore old and damaged products of an architectural heritage. © 2023 by the authors.",

    "abstract":"In real estate appraisal, the building conditions have a significant impact on the asset value. The condition of the building can be estimated based on the characteristics of the external wall materials, architectural style and appearance. Such estimates are complicated because images of buildings contain a lot of confusing information, including different angles and weather Now it is often based on the appraiser's experience, but this introduces too many human factors. Increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence technology can help solve these problems and provide accurate and objective evaluation of buildings. For practical application, this paper divides buildings into three categories with different values according to their conditions. Then train the building images and verify the accuracy by ResNet-152 neural network. The experimental results show that ResNet-152 has a high accuracy and adaptability for building classification tasks.  © 2023 IEEE.",

    "abstract":"Artificial intelligence and image processing methods are key in classifying architectural styles in this digital era. Previous research has demonstrated the success of Deep Learning (DL) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques in classifying architectural styles, but variations in accuracy and challenges in dealing with variations in lighting, shooting angles, and complexity of architectural styles remain a concern. Through literature exploration, it was found that a direct comparison between the ResNet50V2 and MobileNetV2 models in the context of architectural style classification has never been carried out thoroughly. Disadvantages of existing methods include a better understanding of the model's ability to distinguish subtle nuances in architectural design. This research aims to compare the performance of ResNet50V2 and MobileNetV2 in architectural style classification. ResNet50V2 achieved 93% accuracy, while MobileNetV2 achieved 82%. Graphical analysis and evaluation metrics, including confusion matrices and classification reports, provide deep insight into their performance. In conclusion, ResNet50V2 and MobileNetV2 have their respective advantages and disadvantages. ResNet50V2 shows high and stable accuracy, while MobileNetV2 shows stability with certain fluctuations. Both models have the potential to be used in architectural style classification, but model selection must consider the specific needs and characteristics of the dataset. This research is expected to provide valuable guidance for developing more efficient and reliable classification methods in understanding and preserving building architectural styles. This research contribution is relevant to the industrial development trend, which increasingly relies on technology to increase efficiency and accuracy in various tasks. © 2024 IEEE.",

    "abstract":"The task of identifying urban architectural styles occupies a very necessary position in the fields of construction of smart cities, sustainable urban development and community regeneration. The research method proposed in this paper can improve on the inconveniences of traditional methods of identifying urban architectural styles, such as: the community building is relatively old, and the integration of more periods of architectural style can significantly affect the test results. It is an established fact that data cannot be collected and processed efficiently by humans alone, and can not enter such qualitative and descriptive research methods into the computer for auxiliary research. This paper is based on the explosion of information data use in the 21st century, and use deep learning technology to process unstructured data with convolutional neural networks as the core to assist in the identification of urban architectural styles. With the rapid development of deep learning technology in recent years, its classification techniques for identification of street images of urban buildings can be used for urban management, and a new strong underpinning for the allocation of urban resources, urban diversification management, and the transformation of old communities in the later period has been provided by the proper classification of urban architectural styles. Notwithstanding its restrictions, the approach presented in this research has shown promise and the valuable value of deep learning-based techniques for the study of architectural styles, and this approach has universal significance.  © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.",

    "abstract":"Iranian architecture, also known as Persian architecture, encompasses the design of buildings in Iran and extends to various regions in West Asia, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. With a rich history dating back at least 5,000 BC, it boasts distinctive features and styles. Iran, located in the Middle East, has faced ongoing geopolitical challenges, including the potential for conflicts, such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan. Unfortunately, historical monuments often become unintentional casualties during wartime, suffering damage or destruction. These historical monuments hold cultural and historical significance not only for the country they belong to but for all of humanity. Therefore, it is crucial to make efforts to preserve them. In this paper, we propose the development of an automated system utilizing Deep Learning methods for the detection and recognition of historical monuments. This system can be integrated into military equipment to help identify the architectural style of a building and determine its construction date. By doing so, it can provide a critical warning to prevent the targeting of historically significant structures. To support our system, we have curated a dataset consisting of approximately 3,000 photographs showcasing six distinct styles of Iranian historical architecture. Figure 1 provides some examples of these photographs. It is worth noting that this dataset can be valuable for various scientific research projects and applications beyond our proposed system. Additionally, it offers tourists the opportunity to learn about Iranian historical monuments independently, using their mobile phones to access information about a monument’s historical period and architectural style, eliminating the need for a traditional guide. This initiative aims to safeguard the invaluable cultural heritage of Iran and neighboring regions, contributing to the collective preservation of these historical treasures. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

    "abstract":"An edge detection technology based on the combination of non-downsampling contour wave transform (NSCT) and tensor voting is proposed, which aims to obtain more accurate and detailed edge information of buildings in remote sensing images. Firstly, NSCT is used for image decomposition to obtain the subband frequency information of different scales and angles. Then, position encoding is performed on these subband coefficients to obtain second-order symmetric tensors at the corresponding positions. Tensors of different scales and angles at the same position are weighted and summed to complete feature fusion. Finally, the edge features of the image are obtained based on tensor voting theory. The experimental results show that compared to common edge detection technologies, such as Canny, Fast Edge (Fast edge detection using structured forests) and HED (Holistically-Nested Edge Detection), our method can more accurately and intensively reflect the boundaries of buildings and the edge information of roofs, providing better support for the analysis of building types and architectural styles. Compared to the HED method, which is based on deep learning, our method improves PSNR and SSIM metrics by 0.98 and 0.03, respectively.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

    "abstract":"The visual quality and spatial distribution of architectural styles represent a city’s image, influence inhabitants’ living conditions, and may have positive or negative social consequences which are critical to urban sensing and designing. Conventional methods of identifying architectural styles rely on human labor and are frequently time-consuming, inefficient, and subjective in judgment. These issues significantly affect the large-scale management of urban architectural styles. Fortunately, deep learning models have robust feature expression abilities for images and have achieved highly competitive results in object detection in recent years. They provide a new approach to supporting traditional architectural style recognition. Therefore, this paper summarizes 22 architectural styles in a study area which could be used to define and describe urban architectural styles in most Chinese urban areas. Then, this paper introduced a Faster-RCNN general framework of architectural style classification with a VGG-16 backbone network, which is the first machine learning approach to identifying architectural styles in Chinese cities. Finally, this paper introduces an approach to constructing an urban architectural style dataset by mapping the identified architectural style through continuous street view imagery and vector map data from a top-down building contour map. The experimental results show that the architectural style dataset created had a precision of 57.8%, a recall rate of 80.91%, and an F1 score of 0.634. This dataset can, to a certain extent, reflect the geographical distribution characteristics of a wide variety of urban architectural styles. The proposed approach could support urban design to improve a city’s image. © 2023 by the authors.",

Deep learning techniques lose accuracy as they generalize information, while the visual contents of a building exhibit a considerable range and diversity. This study leverages the pose detection technique to tackle such issues by focusing on a common construction style: reinforced concrete buildings representing columns, beams, or floors on the façade. With an aim to enable the assessment of seismic vulnerability, the technique developed herein is conceived for buildings with up to six stories that are more likely to be moment-frame buildings. The AI-enabled proposed framework starts with collecting building images and categorizing those containing this specific building type. A bounding box detector is then used to isolate building facades, for the subsequent identification of the structural frame with the High-Resolution Network (HR-Net). For demonstration, we illustrate this technique by identifying the structural frame on concrete buildings with a sample dataset developed based on buildings found in Mexico City in a pre-earthquake event state. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "abstract":"This paper presents an intelligent model for building architectural style classification. Image classification of architectural style is challenging to traditional machine vision methods. The main challenge in these systems is the feature extraction phase as there are many visual features in these styles that need to be extracted, refined and optimised. All these operations are done at the researcher discretion in traditional Machine Learning (ML) models. The advancements of ML to Deep Learning (DL) made automation of all the challenging operations possible. We constructed a machine vision model based on DL to investigate the effectiveness of DL in the classification problem at hand. A publicly available annotated data set was utilised to train and validate the proposed model. The data set consists of more than 5000 images of eight different architectural styles. The experimental results showed that the proposed model is reliable as it produced a classification accuracy of 95.44%. Copyright © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",

    "abstract":"Precise identification and categorization of building materials are essential for informing strategies related to embodied carbon reduction, building retrofitting, and circularity in urban environments. However, existing building material databases are typically limited to individual projects or specific geographic areas, offering only approximate assessments. Acquiring large-scale and precise material data is hindered by inadequate records and financial constraints. Here, we introduce a novel automated framework that harnesses recent advances in sensing technology and deep learning to identify roof and facade materials using remote sensing data and Google Street View imagery. The model was initially trained and validated on Odense's comprehensive dataset and then extended to characterize building materials across Danish urban landscapes, including Copenhagen, Aarhus, and Aalborg. Our approach demonstrates the model's scalability and adaptability to different geographic contexts and architectural styles, providing high-resolution insights into material distribution across diverse building types and cities. These findings are pivotal for informing sustainable urban planning, revising building codes to lower carbon emissions, and optimizing retrofitting efforts to meet contemporary standards for energy efficiency and emission reductions. © 2025",

    "abstract":"Architectural styles and their evolution are central to architecture history. However, traditional approaches to understand styles and their evolution require domain expertise, fieldwork and extensive manual processes. Recent research in deep learning and computer vision has highlighted the great potential in analyzing urban environments from images. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based framework for understanding architectural styles and age epochs by deciphering building façades based on street-level imagery. The framework is composed of two stages: Deep ‘Learning’ the architecture and Deep ‘Interpreting’ the architecture age epochs and styles. In Deep ‘Learning’, a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model is designed to automatically learn about the age characteristics of building façades from street view images. In Deep ‘Interpreting’ stage, three components are proposed to understand the different perspectives regarding building ages and styles. In the experiment, a building age epoch dataset is compiled for the city of Amsterdam and Stockholm to understand the evolution of architectural element styles and the relationship between building ages and styles spatially and temporally. This research illustrates how publicly available data and deep learning could be used to trace the evolution of architectural styles in the spatial-temporal domain. © 2022",

    "abstract":"The country's historical and artistic heritage represents its identity and history. Art cities are often influenced by different architectural styles, sometimes easily distinguishable, thanks to characteristic elements, other times less so, due to influences caused by transition periods from one style to another, or by interventions over the centuries. Artificial Intelligence in recent years, has proven to be a valuable tool in the field of image classification, given its capacity to yield robust solutions across diverse domains. However, its application in the cultural heritage building image classification context remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a preliminary feasibility study aimed at investigating the potential of deep learning techniques for the classification of cultural heritage building images. The goal could be to build a solution that can recognize, given an image of a historic building, the architectural style, which could improve the experience of a tourist who wants to know more about the visited place's history. The paper examines the results obtained with different neural network architectures, exploiting the Transfer Learning technique, but also draws attention to the challenges of the domain. Overall, encouraging results (AUC 0.98 and F1-score equal to 94-95%), demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques tested and show how AI can help the classification and preservation of cultural heritage building. © 2024 IEEE.",

In the field survey of ethnic minority buildings in Kangba, Sichuan, 1100 images of local buildings were collected, including 8 different types of ethnic minority buildings. The experimental results show that compared with other mainstream deep neural network models, the Swin Transformer visual model shows excellent predictive performance to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. This study also uses the t-sne dimension reduction method to verify the feature extraction ability of the Swin Transformer, which contributes to the protection and restoration of ethnic minority buildings, active exploration of energy conservation, digital archiving, and more. Provide theoretical and practical reference in the fields of architectural style and cultural research. © The Author(s) 2024.",

    "abstract":"With recent advancements in mobile computing, augmented reality (AR) applications can now achieve real-time performance. AR provides a novel way to engage with our surroundings. Platforms such as ARKit or ARCore make AR app development easy. ARchitect aims to allow users to experience different architectural styles and cultural heritages by altering the appearance of buildings in their environment. The presented solution utilizes deep learning and computer vision techniques to classify architectural styles, which is a challenging task due to the inter-class relationships between styles. The approach presented in the paper alters the style of a building detected from the phone’s camera and retrieves information such as its current style, age, and distance from the user. To train the deep learning models, a publicly available dataset of photos of buildings with 25 different styles is used. The obtained results for architectural style classification surpass state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning techniques. Additionally, the presented approach for architectural style transformation is also promising and will improve as new research is conducted in image generation, monocular depth estimation, and surface reconstruction methods. © 2023, Politechnica University of Bucharest.

    "abstract":"This paper investigates state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to achieve automatic architectural style classification of the Chinese traditional settlements. First, a new annotated dataset is built with six typical Chinese architectural styles, consisting of over 1000 web-crawled images and an original image collection of Chinese traditional settlements. Second, a state-of-the-art convolutional network named DenseNet is benchmarked on the new dataset to learn the effectiveness of the deep learning networks. Yet, the DenseNet network suffered server overfitting on the small-sized new dataset. Third, to overcome the common overfitting problem, a new deep learning framework named DenseNet-TL-Aug is developed by leveraging transfer learning (TL) and data augmentation (DA) techniques, e.g., AutoAugment. The experimental results demonstrate that the new developed framework achieves much better classification performance in classifying the Chinese traditional style images than the original DenseNet, significantly mitigating the overfitting problem. This study will contribute to automated landscape gene recognition as well as the design and development of traditional tourism. © 2023 SPIE.",

    "abstract":"The automatic description of multimedia content was mainly developed for classification tasks, retrieval systems and massive ordering of data. Preservation of cultural heritage is a field of high importance for application to this method. Our problem is classification of architectural styles of buildings in digital photographs of Mexican cultural heritage. The selection of relevant content in the scene for training classification models allows them to be more precise in the classification task. Here we use a saliency-driven approach to predict visual attention in images and use it to train a Convolutional Neural Network to identify the architectural style of Mexican buildings. Also, we present an analysis of the behavior of the models trained under the traditional cropped image and the prominence maps. In this sense, we show that the performance of the saliency-based CNNs is better than the traditional training reaching a classification rate of 97% in validation dataset. It is considered that style identification with this technique can make a wide contribution in video description tasks, specifically in the automatic documentation of Mexican cultural heritage. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",

    "abstract":"Urban environments are regions in which spectral variability and spatial variability are extremely high, with a huge range of shapes and sizes, and they also demand high resolution images for applications involving their study. Due to the fact that these environments can grow even more over time, applications related to their monitoring tend to turn to autonomous intelligent systems, which together with remote sensing data could help or even predict daily life situations. The task of mapping cities by autonomous operators was usually carried out by aerial optical images due to its scale and resolution; however new scientific questions have arisen, and this has led research into a new era of highly-detailed data extraction. For many years, using artificial neural models to solve complex problems such as automatic image classification was commonplace, owing much of their popularity to their ability to adapt to complex situations without needing human intervention. In spite of that, their popularity declined in the mid-2000s, mostly due to the complex and time-consuming nature of their methods and workflows. However, newer neural network architectures have brought back the interest in their application for autonomous classifiers, especially for image classification purposes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been a trend for pixel-wise image segmentation, showing flexibility when detecting and classifying any kind of object, even in situations where humans failed to perceive differences, such as in city scenarios. In this paper, we aim to explore and experiment with state-of-the-art technologies to semantically label 3D urban models over complex scenarios. To achieve these goals, we split the problem into two main processing lines: first, how to correctly label the façade features in the 2D domain, where a supervised CNN is used to segment ground-based façade images into six feature classes, roof, window, wall, door, balcony and shop; second, a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) workflow is used to extract the geometry of the façade, wherein the segmented images in the previous stage are then used to label the generated mesh by a \"reverse\" ray-tracing technique. This paper demonstrates that the proposed methodology is robust in complex scenarios. The façade feature inferences have reached up to 93% accuracy over most of the datasets used. Although it still presents some deficiencies in unknown architectural styles and needs some improvements to be made regarding 3D-labeling, we present a consistent and simple methodology to handle the problem. © 2018 by the authors.",

    "abstract":"Objectives: Each region has specific characteristics of architectural styles, and a detailed investigation of the geographical distribution of architectural styles is conducive to the protection of historic buildings, the development of special tourism resources and the scientific planning of urban architectural areas. However, the number of urban buildings is large, manual collection and investigation cannot meet the needs of large-scale operations. In recent years, Google and other Internet companies have launched street view images. Street view images are high resolution, containing a full range of urban street views as well as precise location and posture information, which provide a possibility to explore the geographic distribution of urban architectural styles. Therefore, we use deep learning to identify and match the styles of street view building areas, and establish a mapping relationship between the building area images and building outlines, so as to construct the generation method of a large-scale urban architectural style map in detail. Methods: The style identification and map matching of architectural areas in street view images are the key and difficulty in generating urban architectural style maps. Firstly, we extract the building area images of various styles through Faster R-CNN. In order to establish the mapping relationship between building area images and single building outlines, we construct a building location mapping method by matching the same name building area in two adjacent street view images, then the building can be located by forward intersection. Secondly, for the single building image without a same-name area, we also propose a building azimuth mapping method, which combines the spatial azimuth relationship between the street view building area and building outlines in a digital map. The intersection of union (IoU) of the single building image azimuth range and the building outline azimuth range can help match the building area in a street view image and building outlines in a digital map. Finally, Technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution is used to determine the unique style attribute of each map building outline to solve the multiple mapping problem of a single building and generate a fine-grained architectural style map. Results: The experimental results of the proposed method are as follows: (1) The average accuracy of Faster R-CNN detection of 19 types of architectural style areas on the test set is 73.81%. (2) The accuracy of matching two adjacent street images with the same name architectural area is 86.1%, the recall is 90.3%, and the average time to match an architectural region pair is 180.1 ms, which is 25.4% less than the time using SURF(speeded up robust features) under spherical epipolar geometry constraint and an accuracy improvement of 19.4%; (3) The accuracy of a building location mapping method is 85.1%, the mapping success rate is only 49.33%, and the average time for two corresponding building area to complete location mapping is 2.741 s; the accuracy of the building azimuth mapping method is 80.3%, the mapping success rate is 88.0%, and the average time for a single building area to complete azimuth mapping is 0.017 s. (4) In the test region, the building azimuth mapping method is more likely to cause multiple mapping problems, with 42.9% of the building outlines matching to multiple building images compared to 23.4% for the building location mapping method. (5) By verifying the style attributes of 331 building outlines in a digital map, we obtain a mean classification accuracy of 55.1%, a mean recall of 76.4%, and a mean F1 score of 0.601 for the architectural style maps. Conclusions: Under the two architectural area mapping methods, the generation time of architectural style maps is short, and the F1 score of classification is 0.601, which can basically reflect the geographic distribution characteristics of a large range of urban architectural styles. In addition, the regional and similarity of architectural styles is the main reason for the difficulty in classifying architectural style images, which affects the classification accuracy of architectural style maps and can be studied in more depth in the future. © 2021, Editorial Board of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University.

    "abstract":"Architectural design is a multifaceted process that traditionally requires extensive time and expertise, often leading to inefficiencies and prolonged project timelines. This study explores the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically an optimized CycleGAN, to address these challenges by integrating architectural style transfer and classification into a single, end-to-end model. The model is trained on a diverse dataset comprising modern and traditional architectural styles, enabling it to transform modern architectural images into traditional styles while simultaneously categorizing the architectural style of each input. The results indicate that the model effectively generates traditional architectural styles from modern inputs, capturing key stylistic elements such as texture and form. However, the classification module reveals an imbalance in performance, with higher accuracy and lower loss for traditional style compared to modern style, suggesting areas for improvement. The findings underscore the potential of AI in revolutionizing architectural design, offering a more efficient, accurate, and streamlined process that can significantly enhance the precision and speed of architectural projects. This study contributes to the growing body of research on AI in architecture, demonstrating its applicability in real-world design scenarios. © 2024 IEEE.",

We trained a squeeze net model using different classification algorithms to identify 1404 architects' photos with 88.6% accuracy by integrating a dataset of web-scraped photographs with our collection of architectural works. By analyzing the weights in the trained Neural Network model, we may determine the extent to which the computer understands common aesthetic traits across architects. We use this metric to categorize buildings by various architects into groups sharing commonalities in their design. We next evaluate our results against the standard categorization used by architects and historians.

    "abstract":"The automatic description of digital multimedia content was mainly developed for classification tasks, retrieval systems and massive ordering of data. Preservation of cultural heritage is a field of high importance of application of these methods. We address classification problem in cultural heritage such as classification of architectural styles in digital photographs of Mexican cultural heritage. In general, the selection of relevant content in the scene for training classification models makes the models more efficient in terms of accuracy and training time. Here we use a saliency-driven approach to predict visual attention in images and use it to train a Deep Convolutional Neural Network. Also, we present an analysis of the behavior of the models trained under the state-of-the-art image cropping and the saliency maps. To train invariant models to rotations, data augmentation of training set is required, which posses problems of filling normalization of crops, we study were different padding techniques and we find an optimal solution. The results are compared with the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and training time. Furthermore, we are studying saliency cropping in training and generalization for another classical task such as weak labeling of massive collections of images containing objects of interest. Here the experiments are conducted on a large subset of ImageNet database. This work is an extension of preliminary research in terms of image padding methods and generalization on large scale generic database. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "abstract":"Unlike other studies, this study aims to examine the effect of data diversity and quantity on the performance of a model rather than solely focusing on classifying architectural styles. It also seeks to emphasize the importance of selecting the appropriate number of classes in architectural style classification and to explore how determining the optimal number of classes affects the model's success. The first dataset comprises the original images (4776 images), the second dataset (10091 images) includes additional data and the third dataset (9552 images) is obtained through data augmentation. Using these three datasets, models were developed by reducing the number of classes with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which utilize convolution layers to identify local features in the images and classify them by summarizing these features. The results of the developed models show that the method of adding data and increasing data decreased the success of architectural style classification, whereas reducing the number of styles increased it. This study may lay the groundwork for the development of deep learning models for future architectural style classification. The findings of this study can significantly impact various application areas, such as analyzing architectural styles, identifying historical periods and integrating them into architectural education. © 2024, Jomard Publishing.

    "abstract":"Deep neural networks (DNN) have been widely used for image classification. One major hurdle of deep learning approaches is that large sets of labeled data are necessary, which can be prohibitively costly to obtain, particularly in architectural style classification. Data augmentation can alleviate this labeling effort. In this paper, we use data augmentation to increase the number of architectural style datasets. To extract building elements, the inputs are preprocessed by Deformable Part Model (DPM) first, and then the preprocessed images are sent to the data augmentation to increase the number of images. Next, we design a deep neural network based on GoogLeNet. The proposed network aims to learn robust feature embeddings to improve architectural style classification performance. Finally, architectural style can be classified by the robust feature embeddings. Experimental results show that our approach achieves promising performance and is superior to previous methods. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",

    "abstract":"The classification of architectural style is one of the most challenging problems in architectural history due to its temporal inter-class relationships between different styles and geographical variation within one style. Previous computer version approaches have primarily focused on general classification of multiple architectural styles based on historical age, but very few studies have attempted deep learning to address intra-class classification problems according to geographical location, which might reveal the significance of local evolution and adaption of ancient architectural style. Therefore, we exemplified gothic architecture as a certain genre and leased a new dataset containing gothic architecture in three different countries: France, England, and Italy. Besides, a trained model is susceptible to overfitting due to fecundity of regional parameters and shortcoming of dataset. In this paper, we propose a new approach to accurately classify intra-class variance in the sense of their geographical locations: visualization of Convolutional Neural Network. Experimentation on this dataset shows that the approach of intra-class classification based on local features achieves high classification rate. We also present interpretable explanations for the results, to illustrate architectural indication of intra-class classification. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

    "abstract":"An important part of art history can be discovered through the visual information in monument facades. However, the analysis of this visual information, i.e, morphology and architectural elements, requires high expert knowledge. An automatic system for identifying the architectural style or detecting the architectural elements of a monument based on one image will certainly help improving our knowledge in art and history. Building such tool is challenging as some styles share architectural elements, the bad conservation state of some monuments and the noise included in the image itself. The aim of this paper is to introduce MonuMAI (Monument with Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence) framework. In particular, (i) we designed MonuMAI dataset rich with expert knowledge considering the proposed architectural styles taxonomy and key elements relationship, which allows addressing several tasks, e.g., monument style classification and architectural elements detection, (ii) we developed MonuMAI deep learning pipeline based on lightweight MonuNet architecture for monument style classification and MonuMAI Key Elements Detection (MonuMAI-KED) model, and (iii) we built citizen science based MonuMAI mobile app that uses the proposed MonuMAI deep learning pipeline trained on MonuMAI dataset for performing in real life conditions. Our experiments show that both MonuNet architecture and the detection model achieve very good results under real life conditions. © 2020",

    "abstract":"India is known for its rich architectural and cultural inheritance. In this research work, classification of the Indian historical monuments has been attempted in two levels, primarily based on the time period of its construction and secondly based on its architectural style, using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. A rich corpus of monument images of varying historical periods and architectural styles has been collected from the web, blogs, and tourism websites. Feature extraction methods such as speeded-up robust feature (SURF), scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), features from accelerated segment test (FAST), oriented FAST and rotated brief (ORB), Hu moments, image moments, and Zernike moments are used to extract the features from the input images. ML techniques such as decision tree algorithm (ID3) were used for time period classification in the first level and support vector machine (SVM) for classification of architectural style in the second level. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed and validated for training and testing images for both the levels of classification to observe the performance of DL technique in monument classification. Results of this research show that features extracted using Hu moments and Zernike moments resulted in improved accuracy compared to other feature sets. CNN outperforms ML approaches in overall accuracy in both levels of monument classification and also for few specific architectural styles. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

    "abstract":"Collapsed buildings should be detected with the highest priority during earthquake emergency response, due to the associated fatality rates. Although deep learning-based damage detection using vertical aerial images can achieve high performance, as depth information cannot be obtained, it is difficult to detect collapsed buildings when their roofs are not heavily damaged. Airborne LiDAR can efficiently obtain the 3D geometries of buildings (in the form of point clouds) and thus has greater potential to detect various collapsed buildings. However, there have been few previous studies on deep learning-based damage detection using point cloud data, due to a lack of large-scale datasets. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to develop a dataset tailored to point cloud-based building damage detection, in order to investigate the potential of point cloud data in collapsed building detection. Two types of building data are created: building roof and building patch, which contains the building and its surroundings. Comprehensive experiments are conducted under various data availability scenarios (pre–post-building patch, post-building roof, and post-building patch) with varying reference data. The pre–post scenario tries to detect damage using pre-event and post-event data, whereas post-building patch and roof only use post-event data. Damage detection is implemented using both basic and modern 3D point cloud-based deep learning algorithms. To adapt a single-input network, which can only accept one building’s data for a prediction, to the pre–post (double-input) scenario, a general extension framework is proposed. Moreover, a simple visual explanation method is proposed, in order to conduct sensitivity analyses for validating the reliability of model decisions under the post-only scenario. Finally, the generalization ability of the proposed approach is tested using buildings with different architectural styles acquired by a distinct sensor. The results show that point cloud-based methods can achieve high accuracy and are robust under training data reduction. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the trained models are able to locate roof deformations precisely, but have difficulty recognizing global damage, such as that relating to the roof inclination. Additionally, it is revealed that the model decisions are overly dependent on debris-like objects when surroundings information is available, which leads to misclassifications. By training on the developed dataset, the model can achieve moderate accuracy on another dataset with different architectural styles without additional training. © 2020 by the authors.

    "abstract":"The classification of architectural style for Chinese traditional settlements (CTSs) has become a crucial task for developing and preserving settlements. Traditionally, the classification of CTSs primarily relies on manual work, which is inefficient and time consuming. Inspired by the tremendous success of deep learning (DL), some recent studies attempted to apply DL networks such as convolution neural networks (CNNs) to achieve automated classification of the architecture styles. However, these studies suffer overfitting problems of the CNNs, leading to inferior classification performance. Moreover, most of the studies apply the CNNs as a black box providing limited interpretability. To address these limitations, a new DL classification framework is proposed in this study to overcome the overfitting problem by transfer learning and learning-based data augmentation technique (i.e., AutoAugment). Furthermore, we also employ class activation map (CAM) visualization technique to help understand how the CNN classifiers work to abstract patterns from the input. Specifically, due to a lack of architectural style datasets for the CTSs, a new annotated dataset is first established with six representative classes. Second, several representative CNNs are leveraged to benchmark the new dataset. Third, to address the overfitting problem of the CNNs, a new DL framework is proposed which combines transfer learning and AutoAugment to improve the classification performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on the new dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. The proposed framework achieves much better performance than baselines, greatly mitigating the overfitting problem. Additionally, the CAM visualization technique is harnessed to explain what and how the CNN classifiers implicitly learn for recognizing a specified architectural style. © 2022 by the authors.",

    "abstract":"Classifying architectural structures is an important and challenging task that requires expertise. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are a type of deep learning (DL) approach, have shown successful results in computer vision applications when combined with transfer learning. In this study, we utilized CNN based models to classify regional houses from Anatolia and Balkans based on their architectural styles with various pretrained models using transfer learning. We prepared a dataset using various sources and employed data augmentation and mixup techniques to solve the limited data availability problem for certain regional houses to improve the classification performance. Our study resulted in a classifier that successfully distinguishes 15 architectural classes from Anatolia and Balkans. We explain our predictions using grad-cam methodology. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",
