Specifically, image recognition has been widely applied in various areas such as face recognition, object identification for security, and other purposes. Although it is rarely applied to discover new methods for use in architecture, image recognition has great potential in architectural design. For example, it can be used to identify the preference of the client and to design a building that satisfies a client's aesthetic preference. One of the major hurdles of utilizing image recognition in architecture is the architectural styles based on culture, location, and time. For that reason, it is difficult to identify an architectural style by non-trained clients and sometimes certain buildings are composed of different styles that are difficult to identify by experts as one style. This paper explores the possibility of using state-of-the-art image recognition algorithms in house style recognition to find out its limitations and possibilities. Moreover, the paper adopted a convolutional neural network model for classifying house styles in the US. Although the final accuracy is not high due to the lack of image datasets, the trained model performed reasonable predictions with a limited test set. The results show the importance of properly defining style for image recognition to improve its accuracy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN); Deep learning; House style; Image recognition","Index Keywords":"Architectural design; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Image enhancement; Image recognition; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Sanitary sewers; Speech recognition; Aesthetic preference; Architectural style; Conventional methods; Image datasets; NAtural language processing; Object identification; Recognition algorithm; State of the art; Face recognition","Document Type":"Article","Publication Stage":"Final","Open Access":null,"Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85087091465"},{"Authors":"Zhang X.; Li S.; Chen C.","Author full names":"Zhang, Xiaoxia (57219538029); Li, Shaodan (56654516800); Chen, Changyao (59463797700)","Author(s) ID":"57219538029; 56654516800; 59463797700","Title":"Classification of architectural styles in Chinese traditional settlements using remote sensing images and building facade pictures","Year":2024,"Source title":"Journal of Geographical Sciences","Volume":"34","Issue":"12","Art.

The innovative double-branch classification model developed in this study comprehensively utilized the features of remote sensing (RS) images and building facade pictures (BFPs). This approach was able to overcome the limitations of previous methods that used only building facade images to classify settlements. First, the features of the roofs and walls were extracted using a double-branch structure, which consisted of an RS image branch and BFP branch. Then, a feature fusion module was designed to fuse the features of the roofs and walls. The precision, recall, and F1-score of the proposed model were improved by more than 4% compared with the classification model using only RS images or BFPs. The same three indexes of the proposed model were improved by more than 2% compared with other deep learning models.

The images from the architectural heritage of the Chinese diaspora usually include frescos, decorative patterns, chandelier base patterns, various architectural styles and other major types of architecture. Images of the architectural heritage of the Chinese diaspora in Jiangmen City, Guangdong Province, China are the research object of this study. A total of 5073 images of diaspora Chinese buildings in 64 villages and 16 towns were collected. In view of the fact that different types of image vary greatly in features while there are only small differences among the features of the same type of image, this study uses the depth learning method to design the Convolutional Neural Network Attention Retrieval Framework (CNNAR Framework). This approach can be divided into two stages. In the first stage, the transfer learning method is used to classify the image in question by transferring the trained parameters of the Paris500K datasets image source network to the target network for training, and thus the classified image is obtained. The advantage of this method is that it narrows the retrieval range of the target image. In the second stage, the fusion attention mechanism is used to extract the features of the images that have been classified, and the distance between similar images of the same type is reduced by loss of contrast. When we retrieve images, we can use the features extracted in the second stage to measure the similarities among them and return the retrieval results. The results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed method reaches 98.3% in the heritage image datasets of the JMI Chinese diaspora architectures. The mean Average Precision (mAP) of the proposed algorithm can reach 76.6%, which is better than several mainstream model algorithms. At the same time, the image results retrieved by the algorithm in this paper are very similar to those of the query image. In addition, the CNNAR retrieval framework proposed in this paper achieves accuracies of 71.8% and 72.5% on the public data sets Paris500K and Corel5K, respectively, which can be greatly generalized and can, therefore, also be effectively applied to other topics datasets. The JMI architectural heritage image database constructed in this study, which is rich in cultural connotations of diaspora Chinese homeland life, can provide strong and reliable data support for the follow-up study of the zeitgeist of the culture reflected in architecture and the integration of Chinese and Western aesthetics. At the same time, through the rapid identification, classification, and retrieval of precious architectural images stored in the database, similar target images can be retrieved reasonably and accurately; then, accurate techniques can be provided to restore old and damaged products of an architectural heritage. © 2023 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"architectural heritage; attention mechanism; deep learning; image classification; image retrieval","Index Keywords":null,"Document Type":"Article","Publication Stage":"Final","Open Access":"All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85149232343"},{"Authors":"Li R.; Wang Y.; Liu Y.","Author full names":"Li, Rui (57192998134); Wang, Yaowu (57204333498); Liu, Yang (59107346100)","Author(s) ID":"57192998134; 57204333498; 59107346100","Title":"Study on the classification of building based on ResNet","Year":2023,"Source title":"Proceedings - 2023 11th International Conference on Information Systems and Computing Technology, ISCTech 2023","Volume":null,"Issue":null,"Art.

The condition of the building can be estimated based on the characteristics of the external wall materials, architectural style and appearance.

Increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence technology can help solve these problems and provide accurate and objective evaluation of buildings. For practical application, this paper divides buildings into three categories with different values according to their conditions.

Previous research has demonstrated the success of Deep Learning (DL) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques in classifying architectural styles, but variations in accuracy and challenges in dealing with variations in lighting, shooting angles, and complexity of architectural styles remain a concern. Through literature exploration, it was found that a direct comparison between the ResNet50V2 and MobileNetV2 models in the context of architectural style classification has never been carried out thoroughly. Disadvantages of existing methods include a better understanding of the model's ability to distinguish subtle nuances in architectural design. This research aims to compare the performance of ResNet50V2 and MobileNetV2 in architectural style classification. ResNet50V2 achieved 93% accuracy, while MobileNetV2 achieved 82%. Graphical analysis and evaluation metrics, including confusion matrices and classification reports, provide deep insight into their performance. In conclusion, ResNet50V2 and MobileNetV2 have their respective advantages and disadvantages. ResNet50V2 shows high and stable accuracy, while MobileNetV2 shows stability with certain fluctuations. Both models have the potential to be used in architectural style classification, but model selection must consider the specific needs and characteristics of the dataset. This research is expected to provide valuable guidance for developing more efficient and reliable classification methods in understanding and preserving building architectural styles. This research contribution is relevant to the industrial development trend, which increasingly relies on technology to increase efficiency and accuracy in various tasks. © 2024 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Architectural Style Classification; Artificial Intelligence; Building Heritage; Classification Comparison; Deep Learning; MobileNetV2; Model Performance; ResNet50V2","Index Keywords":"Architectural design; Deep neural networks; Architectural style; Architectural style classification; Building heritage; Classification comparison; Deep learning; In-buildings; Mobilenetv2; Modeling performance; Performance; Resnet50v2; Convolutional neural networks","Document Type":"Conference paper","Publication Stage":"Final","Open Access":null,"Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85202355094"},{"Authors":"Sun H.; Xu H.; Wei Q.","Author full names":"Sun, Haozun (57903673000); Xu, Hong (57203983522); Wei, Quanfeng (58037458900)","Author(s) ID":"57903673000; 57203983522; 58037458900","Title":"The Classification Method of Urban Architectural Styles Based on Deep Learning and Street View Imagery","Year":2022,"Source title":"Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering","Volume":"31","Issue":null,"Art.

The research method proposed in this paper can improve on the inconveniences of traditional methods of identifying urban architectural styles, such as: the community building is relatively old, and the integration of more periods of architectural style can significantly affect the test results. It is an established fact that data cannot be collected and processed efficiently by humans alone, and can not enter such qualitative and descriptive research methods into the computer for auxiliary research. This paper is based on the explosion of information data use in the 21st century, and use deep learning technology to process unstructured data with convolutional neural networks as the core to assist in the identification of urban architectural styles. With the rapid development of deep learning technology in recent years, its classification techniques for identification of street images of urban buildings can be used for urban management, and a new strong underpinning for the allocation of urban resources, urban diversification management, and the transformation of old communities in the later period has been provided by the proper classification of urban architectural styles.

With a rich history dating back at least 5,000 BC, it boasts distinctive features and styles. Iran, located in the Middle East, has faced ongoing geopolitical challenges, including the potential for conflicts, such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan. Unfortunately, historical monuments often become unintentional casualties during wartime, suffering damage or destruction. These historical monuments hold cultural and historical significance not only for the country they belong to but for all of humanity. Therefore, it is crucial to make efforts to preserve them. In this paper, we propose the development of an automated system utilizing Deep Learning methods for the detection and recognition of historical monuments. This system can be integrated into military equipment to help identify the architectural style of a building and determine its construction date. By doing so, it can provide a critical warning to prevent the targeting of historically significant structures. To support our system, we have curated a dataset consisting of approximately 3,000 photographs showcasing six distinct styles of Iranian historical architecture. Figure 1 provides some examples of these photographs. It is worth noting that this dataset can be valuable for various scientific research projects and applications beyond our proposed system. Additionally, it offers tourists the opportunity to learn about Iranian historical monuments independently, using their mobile phones to access information about a monument’s historical period and architectural style, eliminating the need for a traditional guide. This initiative aims to safeguard the invaluable cultural heritage of Iran and neighboring regions, contributing to the collective preservation of these historical treasures. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Author Keywords":"Deep learning; Image classification; Image processing; Iranian architecture","Index Keywords":"Architecture; Automation; Computer architecture; Construction equipment; Deep learning; Historic preservation; Learning systems; Network architecture; Photography; Architectural style; Caucasus; Central Asia; Deep learning; Design of buildings; Historical monuments; Images classification; Images processing; Iranian architectures; Persians; Image classification","Document Type":"Conference paper","Publication Stage":"Final","Open Access":null,"Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85181976688"},{"Authors":"Xu H.; Sun H.; Wang L.; Yu X.; Li T.","Author full names":"Xu, Hong (57203983522); Sun, Haozun (57903673000); Wang, Lubin (57224113359); Yu, Xincan (58484665900); Li, Tianyue (57224901867)","Author(s) ID":"57203983522; 57903673000; 57224113359; 58484665900; 57224901867","Title":"Urban Architectural Style Recognition and Dataset Construction Method under Deep Learning of street View Images: A Case Study of Wuhan","Year":2023,"Source title":"ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information","Volume":"12","Issue":"7","Art.

Conventional methods of identifying architectural styles rely on human labor and are frequently time-consuming, inefficient, and subjective in judgment. These issues significantly affect the large-scale management of urban architectural styles. Fortunately, deep learning models have robust feature expression abilities for images and have achieved highly competitive results in object detection in recent years. They provide a new approach to supporting traditional architectural style recognition. Therefore, this paper summarizes 22 architectural styles in a study area which could be used to define and describe urban architectural styles in most Chinese urban areas. Then, this paper introduced a Faster-RCNN general framework of architectural style classification with a VGG-16 backbone network, which is the first machine learning approach to identifying architectural styles in Chinese cities. Finally, this paper introduces an approach to constructing an urban architectural style dataset by mapping the identified architectural style through continuous street view imagery and vector map data from a top-down building contour map. The experimental results show that the architectural style dataset created had a precision of 57.8%, a recall rate of 80.91%, and an F1 score of 0.634. This dataset can, to a certain extent, reflect the geographical distribution characteristics of a wide variety of urban architectural styles. The proposed approach could support urban design to improve a city’s image. © 2023 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"architectural style recognition; construction method; dataset; deep learning; street view images","Index Keywords":null,"Document Type":"Article","Publication Stage":"Final","Open Access":"All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85166183971"},{"Authors":"Rababaah A.R.; Rababah A.M.","Author full names":"Rababaah, Aaron Rasheed (22958029000); Rababah, Alaa Musa (59042912500)","Author(s) ID":"22958029000; 59042912500","Title":"Intelligent machine vision model for building architectural style classification based on deep learning","Year":2023,"Source title":"International Journal of Computer Applications in Technology","Volume":"70","Issue":"1","Art.

The resulting model showcases the potential for innovative architectural discipline-related analyses and demonstrates some heuristic insights for visual feature extraction pertaining to both architectural functionality and architectural style. © 2021 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.","Author Keywords":"Architectural functionality; Hierarchical classification; Image recognition; Multi-label classification; Style","Index Keywords":"Classification (of information); Deep learning; Image classification; Image recognition; Large dataset; Architectural images; Architectural style; Classification models; Hierarchical multi-label classifications; Multi-label; State of the art; Visual feature extraction; Architectural design","Document Type":"Conference paper","Publication Stage":"Final","Open Access":null,"Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85104623071"},{"Authors":"Obeso A.M.; Benois-Pineau J.; Acosta A.Á.R.; Vázquez M.S.G.","Author full names":"Obeso, Abraham Montoya (57016511800); Benois-Pineau, Jenny (6701750610); Acosta, Alejandro Álvaro Ramirez (6602671796); Vázquez, Mireya Saraí García (24366173900)","Author(s) ID":"57016511800; 6701750610; 6602671796; 24366173900","Title":"Architectural style classification of Mexican historical buildings using deep convolutional neural networks and sparse features","Year":2017,"Source title":"Journal of Electronic Imaging","Volume":"26","Issue":"1","Art.

Art cities are often influenced by different architectural styles, sometimes easily distinguishable, thanks to characteristic elements, other times less so, due to influences caused by transition periods from one style to another, or by interventions over the centuries. Artificial Intelligence in recent years, has proven to be a valuable tool in the field of image classification, given its capacity to yield robust solutions across diverse domains. However, its application in the cultural heritage building image classification context remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a preliminary feasibility study aimed at investigating the potential of deep learning techniques for the classification of cultural heritage building images. The goal could be to build a solution that can recognize, given an image of a historic building, the architectural style, which could improve the experience of a tourist who wants to know more about the visited place's history. The paper examines the results obtained with different neural network architectures, exploiting the Transfer Learning technique, but also draws attention to the challenges of the domain. Overall, encouraging results (AUC 0.98 and F1-score equal to 94-95%), demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques tested and show how AI can help the classification and preservation of cultural heritage building. © 2024 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Cultural Heritage Buildings; Images Classification; Transfer Learning","Index Keywords":"Architecture; Deep learning; Historic preservation; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; Transfer learning; Architectural style; Characteristic elements; Classification system; Cultural heritage building; Cultural heritages; Feasibility analysis; Heritage buildings; Images classification; Learning techniques; Transfer learning; Image classification","Document Type":"Conference paper","Publication Stage":"Final","Open Access":null,"Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85201201577"},{"Authors":"Vlăsceanu G.V.; Drăguț A.; Sandu G.; Tarbă N.; Voncilă M.-L.; Boiangiu C.-A.; Goga N.","Author full names":"Vlăsceanu, Giorgiana Violeta (57192818593); Drăguț, Alin (58563020200); Sandu, Gabriel (57415672400); Tarbă, Nicolae (57223104037); Voncilă, Mihai-Lucian (57110434400); Boiangiu, Costin-Anton (6506993286); Goga, Nicolae (8727472200)","Author(s) ID":"57192818593; 58563020200; 57415672400; 57223104037; 57110434400; 6506993286; 8727472200","Title":"ARCHITECT: EXTRACTING BUILDING RELATED INFORMATIONS AND CHANGING ARCHITECTURAL STYLE IN AR","Year":2023,"Source title":"UPB Scientific Bulletin, Series C: Electrical Engineering and Computer Science","Volume":"85","Issue":"3","Art.

AR provides a novel way to engage with our surroundings. Platforms such as ARKit or ARCore make AR app development easy. ARchitect aims to allow users to experience different architectural styles and cultural heritages by altering the appearance of buildings in their environment. The presented solution utilizes deep learning and computer vision techniques to classify architectural styles, which is a challenging task due to the inter-class relationships between styles. The approach presented in the paper alters the style of a building detected from the phone’s camera and retrieves information such as its current style, age, and distance from the user. To train the deep learning models, a publicly available dataset of photos of buildings with 25 different styles is used. The obtained results for architectural style classification surpass state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning techniques.

Second, a state-of-the-art convolutional network named DenseNet is benchmarked on the new dataset to learn the effectiveness of the deep learning networks. Yet, the DenseNet network suffered server overfitting on the small-sized new dataset. Third, to overcome the common overfitting problem, a new deep learning framework named DenseNet-TL-Aug is developed by leveraging transfer learning (TL) and data augmentation (DA) techniques, e.g., AutoAugment. The experimental results demonstrate that the new developed framework achieves much better classification performance in classifying the Chinese traditional style images than the original DenseNet, significantly mitigating the overfitting problem.

However, the number of urban buildings is large, manual collection and investigation cannot meet the needs of large-scale operations. In recent years, Google and other Internet companies have launched street view images. Street view images are high resolution, containing a full range of urban street views as well as precise location and posture information, which provide a possibility to explore the geographic distribution of urban architectural styles. Therefore, we use deep learning to identify and match the styles of street view building areas, and establish a mapping relationship between the building area images and building outlines, so as to construct the generation method of a large-scale urban architectural style map in detail. Methods: The style identification and map matching of architectural areas in street view images are the key and difficulty in generating urban architectural style maps. Firstly, we extract the building area images of various styles through Faster R-CNN. In order to establish the mapping relationship between building area images and single building outlines, we construct a building location mapping method by matching the same name building area in two adjacent street view images, then the building can be located by forward intersection. Secondly, for the single building image without a same-name area, we also propose a building azimuth mapping method, which combines the spatial azimuth relationship between the street view building area and building outlines in a digital map. The intersection of union (IoU) of the single building image azimuth range and the building outline azimuth range can help match the building area in a street view image and building outlines in a digital map. Finally, Technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution is used to determine the unique style attribute of each map building outline to solve the multiple mapping problem of a single building and generate a fine-grained architectural style map. Results: The experimental results of the proposed method are as follows: (1) The average accuracy of Faster R-CNN detection of 19 types of architectural style areas on the test set is 73.81%. (2) The accuracy of matching two adjacent street images with the same name architectural area is 86.1%, the recall is 90.3%, and the average time to match an architectural region pair is 180.1 ms, which is 25.4% less than the time using SURF(speeded up robust features) under spherical epipolar geometry constraint and an accuracy improvement of 19.4%; (3) The accuracy of a building location mapping method is 85.1%, the mapping success rate is only 49.33%, and the average time for two corresponding building area to complete location mapping is 2.741 s; the accuracy of the building azimuth mapping method is 80.3%, the mapping success rate is 88.0%, and the average time for a single building area to complete azimuth mapping is 0.017 s. (4) In the test region, the building azimuth mapping method is more likely to cause multiple mapping problems, with 42.9% of the building outlines matching to multiple building images compared to 23.4% for the building location mapping method. (5) By verifying the style attributes of 331 building outlines in a digital map, we obtain a mean classification accuracy of 55.1%, a mean recall of 76.4%, and a mean F1 score of 0.601 for the architectural style maps. Conclusions: Under the two architectural area mapping methods, the generation time of architectural style maps is short, and the F1 score of classification is 0.601, which can basically reflect the geographic distribution characteristics of a large range of urban architectural styles. In addition, the regional and similarity of architectural styles is the main reason for the difficulty in classifying architectural style images, which affects the classification accuracy of architectural style maps and can be studied in more depth in the future. © 2021, Editorial Board of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University.

This study explores the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically an optimized CycleGAN, to address these challenges by integrating architectural style transfer and classification into a single, end-to-end model. The model is trained on a diverse dataset comprising modern and traditional architectural styles, enabling it to transform modern architectural images into traditional styles while simultaneously categorizing the architectural style of each input. The results indicate that the model effectively generates traditional architectural styles from modern inputs, capturing key stylistic elements such as texture and form. However, the classification module reveals an imbalance in performance, with higher accuracy and lower loss for traditional style compared to modern style, suggesting areas for improvement. The findings underscore the potential of AI in revolutionizing architectural design, offering a more efficient, accurate, and streamlined process that can significantly enhance the precision and speed of architectural projects.

Preservation of cultural heritage is a field of high importance of application of these methods. We address classification problem in cultural heritage such as classification of architectural styles in digital photographs of Mexican cultural heritage. In general, the selection of relevant content in the scene for training classification models makes the models more efficient in terms of accuracy and training time. Here we use a saliency-driven approach to predict visual attention in images and use it to train a Deep Convolutional Neural Network. Also, we present an analysis of the behavior of the models trained under the state-of-the-art image cropping and the saliency maps. To train invariant models to rotations, data augmentation of training set is required, which posses problems of filling normalization of crops, we study were different padding techniques and we find an optimal solution. The results are compared with the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and training time. Furthermore, we are studying saliency cropping in training and generalization for another classical task such as weak labeling of massive collections of images containing objects of interest. Here the experiments are conducted on a large subset of ImageNet database.

It also seeks to emphasize the importance of selecting the appropriate number of classes in architectural style classification and to explore how determining the optimal number of classes affects the model's success. The first dataset comprises the original images (4776 images), the second dataset (10091 images) includes additional data and the third dataset (9552 images) is obtained through data augmentation. Using these three datasets, models were developed by reducing the number of classes with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which utilize convolution layers to identify local features in the images and classify them by summarizing these features. The results of the developed models show that the method of adding data and increasing data decreased the success of architectural style classification, whereas reducing the number of styles increased it. This study may lay the groundwork for the development of deep learning models for future architectural style classification. The findings of this study can significantly impact various application areas, such as analyzing architectural styles, identifying historical periods and integrating them into architectural education. © 2024, Jomard Publishing.

One major hurdle of deep learning approaches is that large sets of labeled data are necessary, which can be prohibitively costly to obtain, particularly in architectural style classification. Data augmentation can alleviate this labeling effort. In this paper, we use data augmentation to increase the number of architectural style datasets. To extract building elements, the inputs are preprocessed by Deformable Part Model (DPM) first, and then the preprocessed images are sent to the data augmentation to increase the number of images. Next, we design a deep neural network based on GoogLeNet. The proposed network aims to learn robust feature embeddings to improve architectural style classification performance. Finally, architectural style can be classified by the robust feature embeddings. Experimental results show that our approach achieves promising performance and is superior to previous methods. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Author Keywords":"Architectural style classification; Data augmentation; Deep neural networks; Deformable Part Model; GoogLeNet","Index Keywords":"Architecture; Classification (of information); Computer vision; Deep learning; Embeddings; Architectural style; Building element; Classification performance; Data augmentation; Deformable part models; Learning approach; Deep neural networks","Document Type":"Conference paper","Publication Stage":"Final","Open Access":null,"Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85086144925"},{"Authors":"Wang R.; Gu D.; Wen Z.; Yang K.; Liu S.; Jiang F.","Author full names":"Wang, Rui (58912617700); Gu, Donghao (57203245286); Wen, Zhaojing (57210578094); Yang, Kai (57703361600); Liu, Shaohui (7409458485); Jiang, Feng (56681657800)","Author(s) ID":"58912617700; 57203245286; 57210578094; 57703361600; 7409458485; 56681657800","Title":"Intra-class Classification of Architectural Styles Using Visualization of CNN","Year":2019,"Source title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","Volume":"11632 LNCS","Issue":null,"Art.

Previous computer version approaches have primarily focused on general classification of multiple architectural styles based on historical age, but very few studies have attempted deep learning to address intra-class classification problems according to geographical location, which might reveal the significance of local evolution and adaption of ancient architectural style. Therefore, we exemplified gothic architecture as a certain genre and leased a new dataset containing gothic architecture in three different countries: France, England, and Italy. Besides, a trained model is susceptible to overfitting due to fecundity of regional parameters and shortcoming of dataset. In this paper, we propose a new approach to accurately classify intra-class variance in the sense of their geographical locations: visualization of Convolutional Neural Network. Experimentation on this dataset shows that the approach of intra-class classification based on local features achieves high classification rate. We also present interpretable explanations for the results, to illustrate architectural indication of intra-class classification. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Author Keywords":"Architectural Style Classification; Convolutional Neural Network; Visualization","Index Keywords":"Architecture; Convolution; Deep learning; Flow visualization; Network architecture; Neural networks; Visualization; Architectural style; Classification rates; Computer versions; Convolutional neural network; Geographical locations; Geographical variations; Gothic architectures; New approaches; Classification (of information)","Document Type":"Conference paper","Publication Stage":"Final","Open Access":null,"Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85073910804"},{"Authors":"Lamas A.; Tabik S.; Cruz P.; Montes R.; Martínez-Sevilla Á.; Cruz T.; Herrera F.","Author full names":"Lamas, Alberto (57206904461); Tabik, Siham (55884151200); Cruz, Policarpo (37028231900); Montes, Rosana (7006522713); Martínez-Sevilla, Álvaro (6602619556); Cruz, Teresa (57219326116); Herrera, Francisco (7102347190)","Author(s) ID":"57206904461; 55884151200; 37028231900; 7006522713; 6602619556; 57219326116; 7102347190","Title":"MonuMAI: Dataset, deep learning pipeline and citizen science based app for monumental heritage taxonomy and classification","Year":2021,"Source title":"Neurocomputing","Volume":"420","Issue":null,"Art.

However, the analysis of this visual information, i.e, morphology and architectural elements, requires high expert knowledge. An automatic system for identifying the architectural style or detecting the architectural elements of a monument based on one image will certainly help improving our knowledge in art and history. Building such tool is challenging as some styles share architectural elements, the bad conservation state of some monuments and the noise included in the image itself. The aim of this paper is to introduce MonuMAI (Monument with Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence) framework. In particular, (i) we designed MonuMAI dataset rich with expert knowledge considering the proposed architectural styles taxonomy and key elements relationship, which allows addressing several tasks, e.g., monument style classification and architectural elements detection, (ii) we developed MonuMAI deep learning pipeline based on lightweight MonuNet architecture for monument style classification and MonuMAI Key Elements Detection (MonuMAI-KED) model, and (iii) we built citizen science based MonuMAI mobile app that uses the proposed MonuMAI deep learning pipeline trained on MonuMAI dataset for performing in real life conditions. Our experiments show that both MonuNet architecture and the detection model achieve very good results under real life conditions. © 2020","Author Keywords":"Architectural information extraction; Architectural style classification; Convolutional Neural Networks; MonuMAI; Monumental heritage","Index Keywords":"Architecture; E-learning; Historic preservation; Image enhancement; Pipelines; Taxonomies; Architectural element; Architectural style; Automatic systems; Citizen science; Detection models; Expert knowledge; Key elements; Visual information; article; artificial intelligence; citizen science; convolutional neural network; deep learning; extraction; inheritance; mathematics; mobile application; noise; pipeline; taxonomy; Deep learning","Document Type":"Article","Publication Stage":"Final","Open Access":"All Open Access; Green Open Access","Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85092227308"},{"Authors":"Kavitha S.; Mohanavalli S.; Bharathi B.; Rahul C.H.; Shailesh S.; Preethi K.","Author full names":"Kavitha, Srinivasan (35778316000); Mohanavalli, S.

In this research work, classification of the Indian historical monuments has been attempted in two levels, primarily based on the time period of its construction and secondly based on its architectural style, using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. A rich corpus of monument images of varying historical periods and architectural styles has been collected from the web, blogs, and tourism websites. Feature extraction methods such as speeded-up robust feature (SURF), scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), features from accelerated segment test (FAST), oriented FAST and rotated brief (ORB), Hu moments, image moments, and Zernike moments are used to extract the features from the input images. ML techniques such as decision tree algorithm (ID3) were used for time period classification in the first level and support vector machine (SVM) for classification of architectural style in the second level. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed and validated for training and testing images for both the levels of classification to observe the performance of DL technique in monument classification. Results of this research show that features extracted using Hu moments and Zernike moments resulted in improved accuracy compared to other feature sets. CNN outperforms ML approaches in overall accuracy in both levels of monument classification and also for few specific architectural styles. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Author Keywords":"Architectural styles; Convolutional neural network technique; Decision tree algorithm; Indian monuments; Support vector machine algorithm","Index Keywords":null,"Document Type":"Conference paper","Publication Stage":"Final","Open Access":null,"Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85135816689"},{"Authors":"Han Q.; Yin C.; Deng Y.; Liu P.","Author full names":"Han, Qing (57948781500); Yin, Chao (57221927168); Deng, Yunyuan (55220502000); Liu, Peilin (55221147900)","Author(s) ID":"57948781500; 57221927168; 55220502000; 55221147900","Title":"Towards Classification of Architectural Styles of Chinese Traditional Settlements Using Deep Learning: A Dataset, a New Framework, and Its Interpretability","Year":2022,"Source title":"Remote Sensing","Volume":"14","Issue":"20","Art.

Traditionally, the classification of CTSs primarily relies on manual work, which is inefficient and time consuming. Inspired by the tremendous success of deep learning (DL), some recent studies attempted to apply DL networks such as convolution neural networks (CNNs) to achieve automated classification of the architecture styles. However, these studies suffer overfitting problems of the CNNs, leading to inferior classification performance. Moreover, most of the studies apply the CNNs as a black box providing limited interpretability. To address these limitations, a new DL classification framework is proposed in this study to overcome the overfitting problem by transfer learning and learning-based data augmentation technique (i.e., AutoAugment). Furthermore, we also employ class activation map (CAM) visualization technique to help understand how the CNN classifiers work to abstract patterns from the input. Specifically, due to a lack of architectural style datasets for the CTSs, a new annotated dataset is first established with six representative classes. Second, several representative CNNs are leveraged to benchmark the new dataset. Third, to address the overfitting problem of the CNNs, a new DL framework is proposed which combines transfer learning and AutoAugment to improve the classification performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on the new dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. The proposed framework achieves much better performance than baselines, greatly mitigating the overfitting problem. Additionally, the CAM visualization technique is harnessed to explain what and how the CNN classifiers implicitly learn for recognizing a specified architectural style. © 2022 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"architectural style classification; AutoAugment; Chinese traditional settlements; CNN interpretability; convolutional neural networks; cultural heritage; deep learning; Grad-CAM; heritage preservation","Index Keywords":"Architecture; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Network architecture; Visualization; Activation maps; Architectural style; Architectural style classification; Autoaugment; Chinese traditional settlement; Convolution neural network; Convolution neural network interpretability; Convolutional neural network; Cultural heritages; Deep learning; Grad-class activation map; Heritage preservation; Interpretability; Classification (of information)","Document Type":"Article","Publication Stage":"Final","Open Access":"All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Source":"Scopus","EID":"2-s2.0-85140981367"},{"Authors":"Yönder V.M.; İpek E.; Çetin T.; Çavka H.B.; Apaydın M.S.; Doğan F.","Author full names":"Yönder, Veli Mustafa (58612439800); İpek, Emre (58864918500); Çetin, Tarık (58864760100); Çavka, Hasan Burak (56743322000); Apaydın, Mehmet Serkan (6507164359); Doğan, Fehmi (35387836500)","Author(s) ID":"58612439800; 58864918500; 58864760100; 56743322000; 6507164359; 35387836500","Title":"Classification of Turkish and Balkan House Architectures Using Transfer Learning and Deep Learning","Year":2024,"Source title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","Volume":"14366","Issue":null,"Art.
