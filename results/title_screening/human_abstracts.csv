Specifically, image recognition has been widely applied in various areas such as face recognition, object identification for security, and other purposes. Although it is rarely applied to discover new methods for use in architecture, image recognition has great potential in architectural design. For example, it can be used to identify the preference of the client and to design a building that satisfies a client's aesthetic preference. One of the major hurdles of utilizing image recognition in architecture is the architectural styles based on culture, location, and time. For that reason, it is difficult to identify an architectural style by non-trained clients and sometimes certain buildings are composed of different styles that are difficult to identify by experts as one style. This paper explores the possibility of using state-of-the-art image recognition algorithms in house style recognition to find out its limitations and possibilities. Moreover, the paper adopted a convolutional neural network model for classifying house styles in the US. Although the final accuracy is not high due to the lack of image datasets, the trained model performed reasonable predictions with a limited test set. The results show the importance of properly defining style for image recognition to improve its accuracy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.;"Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN); Deep learning; House style; Image recognition";"Architectural design; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Image enhancement; Image recognition; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Sanitary sewers; Speech recognition; Aesthetic preference; Architectural style; Conventional methods; Image datasets; NAtural language processing; Object identification; Recognition algorithm; State of the art; Face recognition";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85087091465

The innovative double-branch classification model developed in this study comprehensively utilized the features of remote sensing (RS) images and building facade pictures (BFPs). This approach was able to overcome the limitations of previous methods that used only building facade images to classify settlements. First, the features of the roofs and walls were extracted using a double-branch structure, which consisted of an RS image branch and BFP branch. Then, a feature fusion module was designed to fuse the features of the roofs and walls. The precision, recall, and F1-score of the proposed model were improved by more than 4% compared with the classification model using only RS images or BFPs. The same three indexes of the proposed model were improved by more than 2% compared with other deep learning models. The results demonstrated that the proposed model performed well in the classification of architectural styles in CTSs. © Science Press 2024.;"architectural style classification; building facade pictures; Chinese traditional settlements; convolutional neural network; remote sensing images";;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85211352369

The images from the architectural heritage of the Chinese diaspora usually include frescos, decorative patterns, chandelier base patterns, various architectural styles and other major types of architecture. Images of the architectural heritage of the Chinese diaspora in Jiangmen City, Guangdong Province, China are the research object of this study. A total of 5073 images of diaspora Chinese buildings in 64 villages and 16 towns were collected. In view of the fact that different types of image vary greatly in features while there are only small differences among the features of the same type of image, this study uses the depth learning method to design the Convolutional Neural Network Attention Retrieval Framework (CNNAR Framework). This approach can be divided into two stages. In the first stage, the transfer learning method is used to classify the image in question by transferring the trained parameters of the Paris500K datasets image source network to the target network for training, and thus the classified image is obtained. The advantage of this method is that it narrows the retrieval range of the target image. In the second stage, the fusion attention mechanism is used to extract the features of the images that have been classified, and the distance between similar images of the same type is reduced by loss of contrast. When we retrieve images, we can use the features extracted in the second stage to measure the similarities among them and return the retrieval results. The results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed method reaches 98.3% in the heritage image datasets of the JMI Chinese diaspora architectures. The mean Average Precision (mAP) of the proposed algorithm can reach 76.6%, which is better than several mainstream model algorithms. At the same time, the image results retrieved by the algorithm in this paper are very similar to those of the query image. In addition, the CNNAR retrieval framework proposed in this paper achieves accuracies of 71.8% and 72.5% on the public data sets Paris500K and Corel5K, respectively, which can be greatly generalized and can, therefore, also be effectively applied to other topics datasets. The JMI architectural heritage image database constructed in this study, which is rich in cultural connotations of diaspora Chinese homeland life, can provide strong and reliable data support for the follow-up study of the zeitgeist of the culture reflected in architecture and the integration of Chinese and Western aesthetics. At the same time, through the rapid identification, classification, and retrieval of precious architectural images stored in the database, similar target images can be retrieved reasonably and accurately; then, accurate techniques can be provided to restore old and damaged products of an architectural heritage. © 2023 by the authors.";"architectural heritage; attention mechanism; deep learning; image classification; image retrieval";;Article;Final;"All Open Access; Gold Open Access";Scopus;2-s2.0-85149232343

The condition of the building can be estimated based on the characteristics of the external wall materials, architectural style and appearance. Such estimates are complicated because images of buildings contain a lot of confusing information, including different angles and weather Now it is often based on the appraiser's experience, but this introduces too many human factors. Increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence technology can help solve these problems and provide accurate and objective evaluation of buildings. For practical application, this paper divides buildings into three categories with different values according to their conditions. Then train the building images and verify the accuracy by ResNet-152 neural network. The experimental results show that ResNet-152 has a high accuracy and adaptability for building classification tasks.  © 2023 IEEE.;"Building Values; Deep Learning; ResNet-152";"Deep learning; Architectural style; Asset value; Building conditions; Building value; Condition; Deep learning; External walls; Real estate appraisals; Resnet-152; Wall materials; Buildings";Conference paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85186766168

Previous research has demonstrated the success of Deep Learning (DL) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques in classifying architectural styles, but variations in accuracy and challenges in dealing with variations in lighting, shooting angles, and complexity of architectural styles remain a concern. Through literature exploration, it was found that a direct comparison between the ResNet50V2 and MobileNetV2 models in the context of architectural style classification has never been carried out thoroughly. Disadvantages of existing methods include a better understanding of the model's ability to distinguish subtle nuances in architectural design. This research aims to compare the performance of ResNet50V2 and MobileNetV2 in architectural style classification. ResNet50V2 achieved 93% accuracy, while MobileNetV2 achieved 82%. Graphical analysis and evaluation metrics, including confusion matrices and classification reports, provide deep insight into their performance. In conclusion, ResNet50V2 and MobileNetV2 have their respective advantages and disadvantages. ResNet50V2 shows high and stable accuracy, while MobileNetV2 shows stability with certain fluctuations. Both models have the potential to be used in architectural style classification, but model selection must consider the specific needs and characteristics of the dataset. This research is expected to provide valuable guidance for developing more efficient and reliable classification methods in understanding and preserving building architectural styles. This research contribution is relevant to the industrial development trend, which increasingly relies on technology to increase efficiency and accuracy in various tasks. © 2024 IEEE.;"Architectural Style Classification; Artificial Intelligence; Building Heritage; Classification Comparison; Deep Learning; MobileNetV2; Model Performance; ResNet50V2";"Architectural design; Deep neural networks; Architectural style; Architectural style classification; Building heritage; Classification comparison; Deep learning; In-buildings; Mobilenetv2; Modeling performance; Performance; Resnet50v2; Convolutional neural networks";Conference paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85202355094

The research method proposed in this paper can improve on the inconveniences of traditional methods of identifying urban architectural styles, such as: the community building is relatively old, and the integration of more periods of architectural style can significantly affect the test results. It is an established fact that data cannot be collected and processed efficiently by humans alone, and can not enter such qualitative and descriptive research methods into the computer for auxiliary research. This paper is based on the explosion of information data use in the 21st century, and use deep learning technology to process unstructured data with convolutional neural networks as the core to assist in the identification of urban architectural styles. With the rapid development of deep learning technology in recent years, its classification techniques for identification of street images of urban buildings can be used for urban management, and a new strong underpinning for the allocation of urban resources, urban diversification management, and the transformation of old communities in the later period has been provided by the proper classification of urban architectural styles. Notwithstanding its restrictions, the approach presented in this research has shown promise and the valuable value of deep learning-based techniques for the study of architectural styles, and this approach has universal significance.  © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.;"deep learning; Style recognition; urban planning";"Architecture; Convolutional neural networks; Image classification; Learning systems; Transfer learning; Urban growth; Architectural style; Classification methods; Community buildings; Deep learning; Established facts; Learning technology; Research method; Style recognition; Sustainable urban development; Urban community; Deep learning";Conference paper;Final;"All Open Access; Gold Open Access";Scopus;2-s2.0-85145256022

This study takes traditional villages in Shandong Province, China, as an example, employing UAV images and deep learning technology. Utilizing the YOLOv8 instance segmentation model, it introduces three key features reflecting the condition of traditional village buildings: roof status, roof form, and courtyard vegetation coverage. By extracting feature data on the condition of traditional village buildings and constructing a transition matrix for building condition changes, combined with corresponding manual judgment assistance, the study classifies, counts, and visually outputs the conditions and changes of buildings. This approach enables the investigation, evaluation, and dynamic monitoring of traditional village buildings. The results show that deep learning technology significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of traditional village architectural investigation and evaluations, and it performs well in dynamic monitoring of building condition changes.

With a rich history dating back at least 5,000 BC, it boasts distinctive features and styles. Iran, located in the Middle East, has faced ongoing geopolitical challenges, including the potential for conflicts, such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan. Unfortunately, historical monuments often become unintentional casualties during wartime, suffering damage or destruction. These historical monuments hold cultural and historical significance not only for the country they belong to but for all of humanity. Therefore, it is crucial to make efforts to preserve them. In this paper, we propose the development of an automated system utilizing Deep Learning methods for the detection and recognition of historical monuments. This system can be integrated into military equipment to help identify the architectural style of a building and determine its construction date. By doing so, it can provide a critical warning to prevent the targeting of historically significant structures. To support our system, we have curated a dataset consisting of approximately 3,000 photographs showcasing six distinct styles of Iranian historical architecture. Figure 1 provides some examples of these photographs. It is worth noting that this dataset can be valuable for various scientific research projects and applications beyond our proposed system. Additionally, it offers tourists the opportunity to learn about Iranian historical monuments independently, using their mobile phones to access information about a monument’s historical period and architectural style, eliminating the need for a traditional guide. This initiative aims to safeguard the invaluable cultural heritage of Iran and neighboring regions, contributing to the collective preservation of these historical treasures. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;"Deep learning; Image classification; Image processing; Iranian architecture";"Architecture; Automation; Computer architecture; Construction equipment; Deep learning; Historic preservation; Learning systems; Network architecture; Photography; Architectural style; Caucasus; Central Asia; Deep learning; Design of buildings; Historical monuments; Images classification; Images processing; Iranian architectures; Persians; Image classification";Conference paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85181976688

Firstly, NSCT is used for image decomposition to obtain the subband frequency information of different scales and angles. Then, position encoding is performed on these subband coefficients to obtain second-order symmetric tensors at the corresponding positions. Tensors of different scales and angles at the same position are weighted and summed to complete feature fusion. Finally, the edge features of the image are obtained based on tensor voting theory. The experimental results show that compared to common edge detection technologies, such as Canny, Fast Edge (Fast edge detection using structured forests) and HED (Holistically-Nested Edge Detection), our method can more accurately and intensively reflect the boundaries of buildings and the edge information of roofs, providing better support for the analysis of building types and architectural styles. Compared to the HED method, which is based on deep learning, our method improves PSNR and SSIM metrics by 0.98 and 0.03, respectively.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.;;"Deep learning; Remote sensing; Tensors; Down sampling; Edge detection technology; Edge information; Frequency information; Image decomposition; Image-based; Remote sensing images; Subbands; Technology-based; Tensor voting; Edge detection";Conference paper;Final;"All Open Access; Gold Open Access";Scopus;2-s2.0-85194173065

Conventional methods of identifying architectural styles rely on human labor and are frequently time-consuming, inefficient, and subjective in judgment. These issues significantly affect the large-scale management of urban architectural styles. Fortunately, deep learning models have robust feature expression abilities for images and have achieved highly competitive results in object detection in recent years. They provide a new approach to supporting traditional architectural style recognition. Therefore, this paper summarizes 22 architectural styles in a study area which could be used to define and describe urban architectural styles in most Chinese urban areas. Then, this paper introduced a Faster-RCNN general framework of architectural style classification with a VGG-16 backbone network, which is the first machine learning approach to identifying architectural styles in Chinese cities. Finally, this paper introduces an approach to constructing an urban architectural style dataset by mapping the identified architectural style through continuous street view imagery and vector map data from a top-down building contour map. The experimental results show that the architectural style dataset created had a precision of 57.8%, a recall rate of 80.91%, and an F1 score of 0.634. This dataset can, to a certain extent, reflect the geographical distribution characteristics of a wide variety of urban architectural styles. The proposed approach could support urban design to improve a city’s image. © 2023 by the authors.;"architectural style recognition; construction method; dataset; deep learning; street view images";;Article;Final;"All Open Access; Gold Open Access";Scopus;2-s2.0-85166183971

The diverse architectural styles of these buildings complicate the automated identification of building information (e.g., number of stories, structural system, and material type). Deep learning techniques lose accuracy as they generalize information, while the visual contents of a building exhibit a considerable range and diversity. This study leverages the pose detection technique to tackle such issues by focusing on a common construction style: reinforced concrete buildings representing columns, beams, or floors on the façade. With an aim to enable the assessment of seismic vulnerability, the technique developed herein is conceived for buildings with up to six stories that are more likely to be moment-frame buildings. The AI-enabled proposed framework starts with collecting building images and categorizing those containing this specific building type.

Image classification of architectural style is challenging to traditional machine vision methods. The main challenge in these systems is the feature extraction phase as there are many visual features in these styles that need to be extracted, refined and optimised. All these operations are done at the researcher discretion in traditional Machine Learning (ML) models. The advancements of ML to Deep Learning (DL) made automation of all the challenging operations possible. We constructed a machine vision model based on DL to investigate the effectiveness of DL in the classification problem at hand. A publicly available annotated data set was utilised to train and validate the proposed model. The data set consists of more than 5000 images of eight different architectural styles. The experimental results showed that the proposed model is reliable as it produced a classification accuracy of 95.44%.

However, traditional approaches to understand styles and their evolution require domain expertise, fieldwork and extensive manual processes. Recent research in deep learning and computer vision has highlighted the great potential in analyzing urban environments from images. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based framework for understanding architectural styles and age epochs by deciphering building façades based on street-level imagery. The framework is composed of two stages: Deep ‘Learning’ the architecture and Deep ‘Interpreting’ the architecture age epochs and styles. In Deep ‘Learning’, a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model is designed to automatically learn about the age characteristics of building façades from street view images. In Deep ‘Interpreting’ stage, three components are proposed to understand the different perspectives regarding building ages and styles. In the experiment, a building age epoch dataset is compiled for the city of Amsterdam and Stockholm to understand the evolution of architectural element styles and the relationship between building ages and styles spatially and temporally. This research illustrates how publicly available data and deep learning could be used to trace the evolution of architectural styles in the spatial-temporal domain. © 2022;"Architectural style; Building age; Built environment; Deep learning; Street view imagery";"Amsterdam [North Holland]; Netherlands; North Holland; Stockholm [Stockholm (CNT)]; Stockholm [Sweden]; Sweden; architectural design; building; computer vision; imagery; machine learning; urban area";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85131439428

Though pre-trained Deep Learning (DL) models are available for Building Feature Extraction (BFE), they are not efficient in predicting the buildings in other locations. This study explores the need and the major issue of implementing DL models for BFE from Very High Resolution Remote Sensing (VHRS) satellite data for any given area. Though advanced DL models are invented, in order to implement them, huge amount of potential training data is demanded for feed in. the building typologies are highly subjected to the context of study area including soil characteristics, culture/lifestyle/economy, architectural style and the building byelaws. The study believes that availability of enough training data of contextual buildings as one of the concern for effective model training. The study aims to extract the buildings present in the study area from Pleiades 1A (2019) RGB VHRS data using simple Mask R-CNN instance segmentation model which is training on the native contextual buildings. Here, an automated method of generating the location-specific training data for a given area is followed using Google Maps API (2021). The generated training data when trained on a deep learning architecture and predicted by the input data yielded promising results. The prediction accuracy of about 98.41% specificity, 96.20% predictive accuracy and 0.89 F1 score are achieved.

Art cities are often influenced by different architectural styles, sometimes easily distinguishable, thanks to characteristic elements, other times less so, due to influences caused by transition periods from one style to another, or by interventions over the centuries. Artificial Intelligence in recent years, has proven to be a valuable tool in the field of image classification, given its capacity to yield robust solutions across diverse domains. However, its application in the cultural heritage building image classification context remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a preliminary feasibility study aimed at investigating the potential of deep learning techniques for the classification of cultural heritage building images. The goal could be to build a solution that can recognize, given an image of a historic building, the architectural style, which could improve the experience of a tourist who wants to know more about the visited place's history. The paper examines the results obtained with different neural network architectures, exploiting the Transfer Learning technique, but also draws attention to the challenges of the domain.

In the field survey of ethnic minority buildings in Kangba, Sichuan, 1100 images of local buildings were collected, including 8 different types of ethnic minority buildings. The experimental results show that compared with other mainstream deep neural network models, the Swin Transformer visual model shows excellent predictive performance to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. This study also uses the t-sne dimension reduction method to verify the feature extraction ability of the Swin Transformer, which contributes to the protection and restoration of ethnic minority buildings, active exploration of energy conservation, digital archiving, and more. Provide theoretical and practical reference in the fields of architectural style and cultural research. © The Author(s) 2024.;"Deep learning; Ethnic minority buildings; Image recognition; Swin transformer; Transfer learning";"article; artificial neural network; controlled study; deep learning; deep neural network; dimensionality reduction; energy conservation; ethnic group; feature extraction; human; learning; nonhuman; transfer of learning; workload";Article;Final;"All Open Access; Gold Open Access";Scopus;2-s2.0-85209733995

AR provides a novel way to engage with our surroundings. Platforms such as ARKit or ARCore make AR app development easy. ARchitect aims to allow users to experience different architectural styles and cultural heritages by altering the appearance of buildings in their environment. The presented solution utilizes deep learning and computer vision techniques to classify architectural styles, which is a challenging task due to the inter-class relationships between styles. The approach presented in the paper alters the style of a building detected from the phone’s camera and retrieves information such as its current style, age, and distance from the user. To train the deep learning models, a publicly available dataset of photos of buildings with 25 different styles is used. The obtained results for architectural style classification surpass state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning techniques. Additionally, the presented approach for architectural style transformation is also promising and will improve as new research is conducted in image generation, monocular depth estimation, and surface reconstruction methods. © 2023, Politechnica University of Bucharest.

First, a new annotated dataset is built with six typical Chinese architectural styles, consisting of over 1000 web-crawled images and an original image collection of Chinese traditional settlements. Second, a state-of-the-art convolutional network named DenseNet is benchmarked on the new dataset to learn the effectiveness of the deep learning networks. Yet, the DenseNet network suffered server overfitting on the small-sized new dataset. Third, to overcome the common overfitting problem, a new deep learning framework named DenseNet-TL-Aug is developed by leveraging transfer learning (TL) and data augmentation (DA) techniques, e.g., AutoAugment. The experimental results demonstrate that the new developed framework achieves much better classification performance in classifying the Chinese traditional style images than the original DenseNet, significantly mitigating the overfitting problem.

Also, we present an analysis of the behavior of the models trained under the traditional cropped image and the prominence maps. In this sense, we show that the performance of the saliency-based CNNs is better than the traditional training reaching a classification rate of 97% in validation dataset.

Due to the fact that these environments can grow even more over time, applications related to their monitoring tend to turn to autonomous intelligent systems, which together with remote sensing data could help or even predict daily life situations. The task of mapping cities by autonomous operators was usually carried out by aerial optical images due to its scale and resolution; however new scientific questions have arisen, and this has led research into a new era of highly-detailed data extraction. For many years, using artificial neural models to solve complex problems such as automatic image classification was commonplace, owing much of their popularity to their ability to adapt to complex situations without needing human intervention. In spite of that, their popularity declined in the mid-2000s, mostly due to the complex and time-consuming nature of their methods and workflows. However, newer neural network architectures have brought back the interest in their application for autonomous classifiers, especially for image classification purposes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been a trend for pixel-wise image segmentation, showing flexibility when detecting and classifying any kind of object, even in situations where humans failed to perceive differences, such as in city scenarios. In this paper, we aim to explore and experiment with state-of-the-art technologies to semantically label 3D urban models over complex scenarios. To achieve these goals, we split the problem into two main processing lines: first, how to correctly label the façade features in the 2D domain, where a supervised CNN is used to segment ground-based façade images into six feature classes, roof, window, wall, door, balcony and shop; second, a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) workflow is used to extract the geometry of the façade, wherein the segmented images in the previous stage are then used to label the generated mesh by a ""reverse"" ray-tracing technique. This paper demonstrates that the proposed methodology is robust in complex scenarios. The façade feature inferences have reached up to 93% accuracy over most of the datasets used. Although it still presents some deficiencies in unknown architectural styles and needs some improvements to be made regarding 3D-labeling, we present a consistent and simple methodology to handle the problem. © 2018 by the authors.";"3D reconstruction; Deep-learning; Façade feature detection; Structure-from-motion";"Antennas; Complex networks; Convolution; Deep learning; Image classification; Image segmentation; Intelligent systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; Problem solving; Ray tracing; Remote sensing; Roofs; 3D reconstruction; Automatic image classification; Autonomous intelligent systems; Convolutional neural network; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); Feature detection; State-of-the-art technology; Structure from motion; Stereo image processing";Article;Final;"All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access";Scopus;2-s2.0-85053636024

However, the number of urban buildings is large, manual collection and investigation cannot meet the needs of large-scale operations. In recent years, Google and other Internet companies have launched street view images. Street view images are high resolution, containing a full range of urban street views as well as precise location and posture information, which provide a possibility to explore the geographic distribution of urban architectural styles. Therefore, we use deep learning to identify and match the styles of street view building areas, and establish a mapping relationship between the building area images and building outlines, so as to construct the generation method of a large-scale urban architectural style map in detail. Methods: The style identification and map matching of architectural areas in street view images are the key and difficulty in generating urban architectural style maps. Firstly, we extract the building area images of various styles through Faster R-CNN. In order to establish the mapping relationship between building area images and single building outlines, we construct a building location mapping method by matching the same name building area in two adjacent street view images, then the building can be located by forward intersection. Secondly, for the single building image without a same-name area, we also propose a building azimuth mapping method, which combines the spatial azimuth relationship between the street view building area and building outlines in a digital map. The intersection of union (IoU) of the single building image azimuth range and the building outline azimuth range can help match the building area in a street view image and building outlines in a digital map. Finally, Technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution is used to determine the unique style attribute of each map building outline to solve the multiple mapping problem of a single building and generate a fine-grained architectural style map. Results: The experimental results of the proposed method are as follows: (1) The average accuracy of Faster R-CNN detection of 19 types of architectural style areas on the test set is 73.81%. (2) The accuracy of matching two adjacent street images with the same name architectural area is 86.1%, the recall is 90.3%, and the average time to match an architectural region pair is 180.1 ms, which is 25.4% less than the time using SURF(speeded up robust features) under spherical epipolar geometry constraint and an accuracy improvement of 19.4%; (3) The accuracy of a building location mapping method is 85.1%, the mapping success rate is only 49.33%, and the average time for two corresponding building area to complete location mapping is 2.741 s; the accuracy of the building azimuth mapping method is 80.3%, the mapping success rate is 88.0%, and the average time for a single building area to complete azimuth mapping is 0.017 s. (4) In the test region, the building azimuth mapping method is more likely to cause multiple mapping problems, with 42.9% of the building outlines matching to multiple building images compared to 23.4% for the building location mapping method. (5) By verifying the style attributes of 331 building outlines in a digital map, we obtain a mean classification accuracy of 55.1%, a mean recall of 76.4%, and a mean F1 score of 0.601 for the architectural style maps. Conclusions: Under the two architectural area mapping methods, the generation time of architectural style maps is short, and the F1 score of classification is 0.601, which can basically reflect the geographic distribution characteristics of a large range of urban architectural styles. In addition, the regional and similarity of architectural styles is the main reason for the difficulty in classifying architectural style images, which affects the classification accuracy of architectural style maps and can be studied in more depth in the future. © 2021, Editorial Board of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University.

Preservation of cultural heritage is a field of high importance of application of these methods. We address classification problem in cultural heritage such as classification of architectural styles in digital photographs of Mexican cultural heritage. In general, the selection of relevant content in the scene for training classification models makes the models more efficient in terms of accuracy and training time. Here we use a saliency-driven approach to predict visual attention in images and use it to train a Deep Convolutional Neural Network. Also, we present an analysis of the behavior of the models trained under the state-of-the-art image cropping and the saliency maps. To train invariant models to rotations, data augmentation of training set is required, which posses problems of filling normalization of crops, we study were different padding techniques and we find an optimal solution. The results are compared with the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and training time. Furthermore, we are studying saliency cropping in training and generalization for another classical task such as weak labeling of massive collections of images containing objects of interest. Here the experiments are conducted on a large subset of ImageNet database.

The resulting framework can be used for image retrieval and other applications related to film production and location scouting. The framework uses deep learning models to extract labels, colors, seasons, emotions, and building architecture from input images. The methodology is described in detail, outlining the different steps involved in image processing and feature extraction. The label extraction module uses a transfer learning approach with pre-trained CNN models fine-tuned on a custom dataset of 106 classes. The color extraction module uses the LAB color space, a device-independent and perceptually uniform color space, in image processing applications, to accurately identify the dominant color, while the season extraction module extracts seasonal information from input images. The emotion extraction module identifies the emotion portrayed in an image, and the architectural style module automatically identifies the style of buildings in photos. Finally, the embedding module combines various vectors representing different image aspects to create a general embedding for each image. © 2023 IEEE.;"artificial intelligence; building architecture identification; CNN models; color extraction; deep learning; embedding; emotion extraction; feature extraction; film production; image processing; image retrieval; LAB color space; label extraction; location scouting; season extraction; transfer learning";"Color; Deep learning; Embeddings; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image processing; Image retrieval; Location; Building architecture identification; CNN models; Color extraction; Colour spaces; Deep learning; Embeddings; Emotion extractions; Features extraction; Film production; Images processing; LAB color space; Label extraction; Location scouting; Season extraction; Transfer learning; Architecture";Conference paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85175611328

It also seeks to emphasize the importance of selecting the appropriate number of classes in architectural style classification and to explore how determining the optimal number of classes affects the model's success. The first dataset comprises the original images (4776 images), the second dataset (10091 images) includes additional data and the third dataset (9552 images) is obtained through data augmentation. Using these three datasets, models were developed by reducing the number of classes with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which utilize convolution layers to identify local features in the images and classify them by summarizing these features. The results of the developed models show that the method of adding data and increasing data decreased the success of architectural style classification, whereas reducing the number of styles increased it. This study may lay the groundwork for the development of deep learning models for future architectural style classification. The findings of this study can significantly impact various application areas, such as analyzing architectural styles, identifying historical periods and integrating them into architectural education. © 2024, Jomard Publishing.

One major hurdle of deep learning approaches is that large sets of labeled data are necessary, which can be prohibitively costly to obtain, particularly in architectural style classification. Data augmentation can alleviate this labeling effort. In this paper, we use data augmentation to increase the number of architectural style datasets. To extract building elements, the inputs are preprocessed by Deformable Part Model (DPM) first, and then the preprocessed images are sent to the data augmentation to increase the number of images. Next, we design a deep neural network based on GoogLeNet. The proposed network aims to learn robust feature embeddings to improve architectural style classification performance. Finally, architectural style can be classified by the robust feature embeddings. Experimental results show that our approach achieves promising performance and is superior to previous methods. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.;"Architectural style classification; Data augmentation; Deep neural networks; Deformable Part Model; GoogLeNet";"Architecture; Classification (of information); Computer vision; Deep learning; Embeddings; Architectural style; Building element; Classification performance; Data augmentation; Deformable part models; Learning approach; Deep neural networks";Conference paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85086144925

Previous computer version approaches have primarily focused on general classification of multiple architectural styles based on historical age, but very few studies have attempted deep learning to address intra-class classification problems according to geographical location, which might reveal the significance of local evolution and adaption of ancient architectural style. Therefore, we exemplified gothic architecture as a certain genre and leased a new dataset containing gothic architecture in three different countries: France, England, and Italy. Besides, a trained model is susceptible to overfitting due to fecundity of regional parameters and shortcoming of dataset. In this paper, we propose a new approach to accurately classify intra-class variance in the sense of their geographical locations: visualization of Convolutional Neural Network. Experimentation on this dataset shows that the approach of intra-class classification based on local features achieves high classification rate. We also present interpretable explanations for the results, to illustrate architectural indication of intra-class classification. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;"Architectural Style Classification; Convolutional Neural Network; Visualization";"Architecture; Convolution; Deep learning; Flow visualization; Network architecture; Neural networks; Visualization; Architectural style; Classification rates; Computer versions; Convolutional neural network; Geographical locations; Geographical variations; Gothic architectures; New approaches; Classification (of information)";Conference paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85073910804

To address the lack of suitable datasets in the literature, a custom dataset has been created and made publicly available. The study aims to determine the most effective model, taking into account fine details in architectural styles. In this context, a comparative analysis has been conducted on four different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, including a baseline model trained from scratch and models using transfer learning methods with VGG, ResNet, and EfficientNet architectures. Through experiments, the EfficientNet architecture was fine-tuned, achieving an accuracy of %84.65 for 3 architects and %74.08 for 16 architects. Additionally, the two obtained models were used as feature extractors to visualize relationships among architects in a 2D space using t-SNE dimension reduction technique. These promising results indicate that these techniques can significantly contribute to architectural style analysis and serve as valuable tools for creating innovative designs through the use of generative artificial intelligence. © 2024 IEEE.;"architectural style; convolutional neural network; deep learning; image classification";"Architecture; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Learning systems; Network architecture; Transfer learning; Architectural style; Architectural work; Baseline models; Comparative analyzes; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Feature extractor; Images classification; Neural network architecture; Transfer learning methods; Image classification";Conference paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85200903651

However, the analysis of this visual information, i.e, morphology and architectural elements, requires high expert knowledge. An automatic system for identifying the architectural style or detecting the architectural elements of a monument based on one image will certainly help improving our knowledge in art and history. Building such tool is challenging as some styles share architectural elements, the bad conservation state of some monuments and the noise included in the image itself. The aim of this paper is to introduce MonuMAI (Monument with Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence) framework. In particular, (i) we designed MonuMAI dataset rich with expert knowledge considering the proposed architectural styles taxonomy and key elements relationship, which allows addressing several tasks, e.g., monument style classification and architectural elements detection, (ii) we developed MonuMAI deep learning pipeline based on lightweight MonuNet architecture for monument style classification and MonuMAI Key Elements Detection (MonuMAI-KED) model, and (iii) we built citizen science based MonuMAI mobile app that uses the proposed MonuMAI deep learning pipeline trained on MonuMAI dataset for performing in real life conditions. Our experiments show that both MonuNet architecture and the detection model achieve very good results under real life conditions. © 2020;"Architectural information extraction; Architectural style classification; Convolutional Neural Networks; MonuMAI; Monumental heritage";"Architecture; E-learning; Historic preservation; Image enhancement; Pipelines; Taxonomies; Architectural element; Architectural style; Automatic systems; Citizen science; Detection models; Expert knowledge; Key elements; Visual information; article; artificial intelligence; citizen science; convolutional neural network; deep learning; extraction; inheritance; mathematics; mobile application; noise; pipeline; taxonomy; Deep learning";Article;Final;"All Open Access; Green Open Access";Scopus;2-s2.0-85092227308

In this research work, classification of the Indian historical monuments has been attempted in two levels, primarily based on the time period of its construction and secondly based on its architectural style, using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. A rich corpus of monument images of varying historical periods and architectural styles has been collected from the web, blogs, and tourism websites. Feature extraction methods such as speeded-up robust feature (SURF), scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), features from accelerated segment test (FAST), oriented FAST and rotated brief (ORB), Hu moments, image moments, and Zernike moments are used to extract the features from the input images. ML techniques such as decision tree algorithm (ID3) were used for time period classification in the first level and support vector machine (SVM) for classification of architectural style in the second level. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed and validated for training and testing images for both the levels of classification to observe the performance of DL technique in monument classification.

Cultural tourism represents a significant economic and social strategy, capable of stimulating regional development and revitalizing marginalized areas. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the sector, offering new ways to engage with and preserve cultural assets. This study explores the application of advanced AI techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to improve the classification and recognition of images related to architectural heritage. A deep learning algorithm specifically designed for cultural heritage enhancement is presented, focusing on the automatic classification of images of buildings and monuments. The analysis includes a comparison between pre-trained models and custom models, highlighting the performance of different approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble model achieved 90% accuracy in classifying architectural heritage elements across 10 categories, with the Majority Vote Ensemble approach outperforming individual models by 6-10%. This improved classification accuracy enables more reliable automated systems for cultural heritage documentation and interactive tourist experiences. The research addresses key challenges in architectural heritage classification including variations in preservation state, lighting conditions, and complex backgrounds with multiple elements. The study also investigates the impact of data augmentation and class balancing techniques on model performance, demonstrating how these methods can mitigate limitations in training data availability. The developed ensemble combines state-of-the-art CNN architectures like ResNet50 and EfficientNet with custom models, leveraging their complementary strengths to achieve robust classification across diverse architectural styles and conditions. The adopted approach is supervised, using a training dataset where images are pre-labeled according to specific categories. This allows the algorithm to learn and subsequently predict the categories of new images based on the acquired information. A practical application is proposed to improve visitor experiences and heritage management, paving the way for future technological advancements in the field. © 2024 IEEE.;"Artificial Intelligence; Augmented Reality; Image Classification; Smart Tourism";"Tourism; Architectural heritage; Convolutional neural network; Cultural heritages; Custom models; Image based system; Images classification; Key elements; Smart tourism; Technological enhancement; Technological innovation; Convolutional neural networks";Conference paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85217998269

Traditionally, the classification of CTSs primarily relies on manual work, which is inefficient and time consuming. Inspired by the tremendous success of deep learning (DL), some recent studies attempted to apply DL networks such as convolution neural networks (CNNs) to achieve automated classification of the architecture styles. However, these studies suffer overfitting problems of the CNNs, leading to inferior classification performance. Moreover, most of the studies apply the CNNs as a black box providing limited interpretability. To address these limitations, a new DL classification framework is proposed in this study to overcome the overfitting problem by transfer learning and learning-based data augmentation technique (i.e., AutoAugment). Furthermore, we also employ class activation map (CAM) visualization technique to help understand how the CNN classifiers work to abstract patterns from the input. Specifically, due to a lack of architectural style datasets for the CTSs, a new annotated dataset is first established with six representative classes. Second, several representative CNNs are leveraged to benchmark the new dataset. Third, to address the overfitting problem of the CNNs, a new DL framework is proposed which combines transfer learning and AutoAugment to improve the classification performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on the new dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. The proposed framework achieves much better performance than baselines, greatly mitigating the overfitting problem. Additionally, the CAM visualization technique is harnessed to explain what and how the CNN classifiers implicitly learn for recognizing a specified architectural style. © 2022 by the authors.;"architectural style classification; AutoAugment; Chinese traditional settlements; CNN interpretability; convolutional neural networks; cultural heritage; deep learning; Grad-CAM; heritage preservation";"Architecture; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Network architecture; Visualization; Activation maps; Architectural style; Architectural style classification; Autoaugment; Chinese traditional settlement; Convolution neural network; Convolution neural network interpretability; Convolutional neural network; Cultural heritages; Deep learning; Grad-class activation map; Heritage preservation; Interpretability; Classification (of information)";Article;Final;"All Open Access; Gold Open Access";Scopus;2-s2.0-85140981367

This study introduces a multi-task deep learning network with a flexible architecture for simultaneously extracting spatial and attributional building information from high-resolution satellite images. This method efficiently segments rooftops and classifies buildings by urban function and architectural style of rooftops. Moreover, a strategic spatial sampling scheme from a data-centric perspective, informed by geographic and environmental diversity, optimizes the selection of representative samples to improve training efficiency and predictive accuracy. Comparative analyses demonstrate the framework's superior performance, achieving an F1 score of 84.30% and an intersection over union of 72.86% in rooftop segmentation, and Kappa scores of 74.67% and 70.04% in classifying urban functions and architectural types, outperforming other advanced models by 2% to 25% across various metrics. Additionally, the adaptability of the network ensures that the framework meets diverse accuracy and efficiency requirements.
