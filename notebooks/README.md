# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, experiments, and demonstrations.

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names with dates or version numbers:
- `01_data_exploration.ipynb`
- `02_model_training.ipynb`
- `03_results_analysis_2025-01.ipynb`

## Guidelines

- Clear markdown cells explaining each step
- Well-commented code cells
- Include visualizations and outputs
- Keep notebooks focused on a single topic or analysis
- Restart kernel and run all cells before committing to ensure reproducibility

## Best Practices

- Use relative paths for data files
- Document package versions if using specific features
- Clear outputs before committing if they're large (optional)
- Export finalized analyses to scripts in the `code/` directory
